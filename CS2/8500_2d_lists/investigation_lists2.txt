For 18 points, answer the following questions, all of which refer to the lists_2d.py code.

1) How exactly would the creation of the grid go wrong if line 81 (shown below) was removed:
temp_row = []

2) Why is the -1 important on these lines (line 104 and 105)?
red_row = random.randint(0,len(grid)-1)
red_column = random.randint(0,len(grid[0])-1)

3) Rewrite these three lines of code (107 through 109) using for i in range:
for row in grid:
    for col in row:
        pygame.draw.rect(surface, green, col)
