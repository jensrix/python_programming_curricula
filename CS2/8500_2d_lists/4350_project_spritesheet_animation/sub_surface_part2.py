For 10 points, write a function that takes as arguments:
    an x, y, width, and height
    and a count
The function then prints out count number of x values with an
increment of width. (Yes, the other arguments will be ignored.)

For example, if x = 10 and width = 15 and count = 4 then the function
would print 10, 25, 40, 55

This is a stepping stone toward a function that will help us create
animated images.
