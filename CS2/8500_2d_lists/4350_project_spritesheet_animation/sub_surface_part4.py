For 50 points, modify your function from part 3. Your new 
function should take as arguments:
    an image,
    an x, y, width, and height
    and number of rows and number of columns
The function then uses two nested for loops to cut out both rows and 
columns from the given image and returns them all in a list.

Finally, use this function to cut out all the rows and columns
from the running man images walksequence_spritesheet.png and animate 
them.
