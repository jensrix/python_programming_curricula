For 50 points, modify your function from part 2. Your new 
function should take as arguments:
    an image,
    an x, y, width, and height
    and a count
The function then cuts out count number of images from the
given image and returns them all in a list.

Finally, use this function to cut out one row of heroes or 
monsters from 0x72_DungeonTilesetII_v1.2.png and animate them.
