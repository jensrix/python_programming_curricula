For up to 240 points, create the Flood-It / Ink Spill Game

Example: https://unixpapa.com/floodit/


Step 1 (for 40 points):
Create a new class called ColorRect that has two attributes, 
a Pygame Rect and a color. ColorRect should also have a draw
function that draws it on the screen when called. Display at 
least one ColorRect on the screen.


Step 2 (for 40 points):
Create a 2-dimensional list of ColorRects and display them as a 
grid on the screen using Pygame.


Step 3 (for 40 points):
Modify your code such that clicking on any rectangle in the grid 
changes the color of the upper left rectangle to the color of 
the rectangle that was clicked.


Step 4 (for 100 points):
Write a function that takes the grid of ColorRects and a color.
The function should flood (aka spill) the color outward from the 
upper left corner. You will need to remember the original color
of the upper left corner.

Refer to the example https://unixpapa.com/floodit/ for what is 
meant by "flood" or "spill".

20 bonus points if this function is RECURSIVE.
