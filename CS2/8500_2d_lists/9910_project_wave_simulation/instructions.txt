NOTE: Do not do projects like this unless students can come up with all the code themselves from scratch. It does them a disservice to write code for them.
This project did not fly well last year and honestly I only did it because I said at the start of the year I would. Flexibility would have been better. No one would have missed this.


PRE: 
Talk through the existing code and run the program.

Walk students through each step of this project. Don't make them do it on their own.


PROJECT:
Write a Pygame copy of the NetLogo Raindrops program

Step 1: Create and draw 2d array of water blobs.
	See TODO1 and TODO2
Step 2: getClickedRowCol. Test this by clicking to change individual cell colors.
	See #TODO3
Step 3: sumNeighborsZs. Test this by having the click change the color and use this to average the colors of neighboring cells.
	See #TODO4
Step 4: releaseDrop, computeDeltaZ, updatePosAndColor. Don't forget to compute all delta z's before updating in the main loop. Also explain the rationale behind computeDeltaZ. The surface tension acts like a trampoline surface. If neighboring cells are above middle cell, then they pull it up. If they are below, they pull it down.
You are given the code for these functions, but you have to put everything together to make them work.

In the main loop, before drawing, loop through and update all delta z's by caling the computeDeltaZ function on each water blob.
	See #TODO5

Uncomment the call to releaseDrop that happens when the mouse is clicked.
	See #TODO6

Don't forget to call updatePosAndColor right before drawing each water blob.



PROJECT RUBRIC:
10 points: Completing all TODOs and ending up with a working wave simulation.

Write your name, the date, and the assignment in a multi-line comment at the top of the program.



POST:
Debreif different student programs and discuss their relative merits.
