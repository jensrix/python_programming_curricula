	4740_bounce_off
Platformer is a misleading name for some of the code in this folder and there is better platformer code in a later folder outside of 9000_bounce_off_breakout.
What I would really like to see in this folder is a working pinball game.

	4745_brick_break_game
This is really all students need to do in this folder. Making a game like breakout or the ipad game is MORE than hard enough.
What you should start with is one large bal bouncing in slow motion off one corner of a large (zoomed in) rectangle to make sure those collisions work.
It was VERY frustrating for some students to not be able to get this working to their satisfaction.
Basically, lots of bounce-off and simple collision stuff needs emphasized before you can dive right in to this.
