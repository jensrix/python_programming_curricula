For 35 points, create a higher/lower guessing game program.
This is the game where the program creates a random number.
The user guesses a number and the program tells the user if 
their guess is too high, too low, or they got it right.

This is an individual project. No teams.

Before starting, create a Program Plan.
You must write down the pieces of the program that are 
needed.

You will turn in your Program Plan and code.

Use the following resources to create your game:

#Here's how to remember a random number between 1 and 100 in the
#variable named secret number:
import random
secret_number = random.randint(1,100)

#Here's how to ask the user to guess a number and store the number
#in a variable named guess.
guess = input("Give me a number")
guess = int(guess) #Convert the text of guess to an integer

#Here's how to loop until the user says "quit"
response = ""
while response != "quit":
    response = input("quit or continue?")

#Here's how to compare two numbers:
x = int(input("Give me a number"))
y = int(input("Give me another number"))
if x>y:
    print('Your first number was bigger')
else:
    print('Your second number was bigger')


#That's all you need to know. Now write the guessing game!
