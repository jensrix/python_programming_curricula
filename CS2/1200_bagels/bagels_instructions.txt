For 200 points, make a "bagels guessing game" program.

You may work in groups of no more than 2. Both students are
eligible for 200 points each.

Before starting, create a Program Plan.
You must write down the pieces of the program that are 
needed, in what order you will write them, and who will 
work on what task.

You will turn in your Program Plan and code.

Here's how the game works:

The player tries to guess a random three-digit number (with 
no repeating digits) generated by the computer. After each guess,
the computer gives the player three types of clues:

	Bagels - None of the three digits guessed is in the secret number.

	Pico - One of the digits is in the secret number, but the guess has the digit in the wrong place.

	Fermi - The guess has a correct digit in the correct place.

The computer can give multiple clues. If the secret number is 
456 and the player's guess is 546, the clues would be 
"fermi pico pico."
The "fermi" is from the 6 and "pico pico" are from the 4 and 5.


Here's what the user sees when they run the Bagels program.
The text the computer writes has a > in front of it.

>I am thinking of a 3-digit number. Try to guess what it is.
>The clues I give are...
>When I say:    That means:
>  Bagels       None of the digits is correct.
>  Pico         One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
>  Fermi        One digit is correct and in the right position.
>I have thought up a number. You have 10 guesses to get it.

Here are some (but not all) suggested pieces of the program:

Write a function, named getClue, that takes two lists and an index.
The function returns the word fermi if the values in each list at 
index are the same.
For example, this code prints "fermi" because the lists have the 
same value at index 1:
list1=[1,2,3]
list2=[3,2,1]
print( getClue(list1,list2,1) )

The getClue function returns the word pico if the value in 
list1 at index is somewhere in list2, but not at the same index.
For example, this code prints "pico" because 2 is in list2, but not
at index 0:
list1=[2,4,8]
list2=[3,2,1]
print( getClue(list1,list2,0) )

The getClue function returns an empty string "" if the value in 
list1 at index is not in list2.
For example, this code prints "" because 8 is not in list2:
list1=[2,4,8]
list2=[3,3,3]
print( getClue(list1,list2,2) )


#Here is how to shuffle the numbers 1 through 10
import random
numbers = list(range(10))
random.shuffle(numbers)
print(numbers)
#Here's how to select only the first three digits
numbers = numbers[:3]
print(numbers)

#Reminder: you can index strings the same way you index lists:
print('hello'[1]) #This prints e
