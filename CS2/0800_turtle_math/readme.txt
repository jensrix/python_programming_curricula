as described in this youtube video:

youtube.com/watch?v=IUC-8P0zXe8

You may work in groups of no more than 2. Both students are
eligible for 180 points each.

Before starting, create a Program Plan.
You must write down the pieces of the program
that are needed, in what order you will write them, and who will 
work on what task.

You will turn in your Program Plan and code.
