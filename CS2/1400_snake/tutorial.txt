Before starting this project, watch this video:

For 180 points, make a Snake program.

You may work in groups of no more than 2. Both students are
eligible for 180 points each.

Before starting, create a Program Plan.
You must write down the pieces of the program that are 
needed, in what order you will write them, and who will 
work on what task.

You will turn in your Program Plan and code.

You should start simple and build up incrementally.
0. Is pygame installed? Do you remember how to use it?
1. Can you draw a rectangle on the screen?
2. How about a list of rectangles?
3. Can you make the rectangles move? THIS IS HARD FOR MOST STUDENTS. How will you move your rectangles?
4. Only after you have those working should you add in controls using event handling and checking for collisions with food or the snake itself.


You may use this tutorial, but you need to cite your sources clearly in the code:
This python tutorial goes all the way from drawing lines to making snake:

If you want, you can add sound effects to your game such as an audio bleep when food is picked up. This webpage will explain the code:
