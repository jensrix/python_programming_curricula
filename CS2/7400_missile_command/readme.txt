For 400 points, write a game of missile command.

In the classic game of missile command, missiles drop from the sky and the
player has to launch counter missiles to intercept them. Missiles explode at
their destination and the explosions can cause chain reactions with other
exploding missiles. See here:

You must use inheritance for this project. For example, explosion classes and 
missile classes can both inherit from a parent class that has x,y variables.

If you did the earlier fireworks project, you can borrow code from there.
