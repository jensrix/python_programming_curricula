Start with the provided code.

TIME LIMIT
For 18 points add a time limit to the game.

SPEED BLIND
For 35 points add the feature that the player can hold down a key to increase their speed but decrease their vision.
You will need to modify what functions.py imports to make this work. You will also need to modify handleEvents to return the modified vision_radius for use in scwary_squares.py.

ENEMY
For 120 points add an enemy (using a class). The enemy should slowly chase the player and the game ends if the enemy catches the player. The enemy does not need to avoid the red rectangles.
