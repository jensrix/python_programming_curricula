For 35 points watch the video and answer these questions:

1. What 3 files did Holt create and import?

2. When Holt first tested his collision function, no collisions occurred. Why?

3. What was the original value of vision_radius before Holt changed it?

4. Why did Holt keep self.x and self.y variables, but rather than simply keeping a self variable to reference the rectangle, he created rectangles inside the draw and collision functions in the Player object?
