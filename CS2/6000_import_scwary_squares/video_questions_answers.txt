For 35 points watch the video and answer these questions:

1. What 3 files did Holt create and import?
constants, functions, player

2. When Holt first tested his collision function, no collisions occurred. Why?
he forgot to call the function

3. What was the original value of vision_radius before Holt changed it?
50

4. Why did Holt keep self.x and self.y variables, but rather than simply keeping a self variable to reference the rectangle, he created rectangles inside the draw and collision functions in the Player object?
the pygame rect rounds rect.x and rect.y to whole numbers.
