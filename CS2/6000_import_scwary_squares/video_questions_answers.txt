1. What 3 files did the narrator create and import?
constants, functions, player

2. When the narrator first tested his collision function, no collisions occurred. Why?
he forgot to call the function

3. What was the original value of vision_radius before the narrator changed it?
50

4. Why did the narrator keep self.x and self.y variables, but rather than simply keeping a self variable to reference the rectangle, he created rectangles inside the draw and collision functions in the Player object?
the pygame rect rounds rect.x and rect.y to whole numbers.
