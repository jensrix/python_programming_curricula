For 100 points, create a fireworks animation using Pygame and objects.

Your program should shoot up a colored circle that should explode into
many colored circles that all fall to the ground.

You must:
 -implement velocity in terms of dx,dy
 -implement gravity
 -use a timeout or frame count to determine when the firework explodes
 -delete fireworks that leave the screen using del and a reversed for loop.

Ask Mr. H if these instructions are unclear.
