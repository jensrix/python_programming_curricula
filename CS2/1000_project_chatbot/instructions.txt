For 200 points, create a chatbot program. A chatbot has a 
conversation with the user through text. Try to make your 
chatbot as intelligent as possible. This will be difficult.

I don't expect an intelligent conversation. Try to make
your chatbot interesting. Perhaps write it as if you are
interviewing a suspect, trying to get them to confess and
the chatbot is the suspect. Or you are trying to convince
the chatbot to go to prom with you. The choice is up to you.

Your chatbot must:
-Handle complete sentences typed in by the user.
-Sometimes use a word typed by the user in its response. For example:
  User: My favorite food is pizza.
  Chatbot: Yes, pizza is delicious.
There are many ways to make this work. You will find some useful code below.

You may work in groups of no more than 2. Both students are
eligible for 200 points each.

Before starting, create a Program Plan.
You must write down the pieces of the program that are 
needed, in what order you will write them, and who will 
work on what task.

You will turn in your Program Plan and code.

Use the following resources to create your chatbot:

There is lots of useful string code here:

#Change text to lowercase:
text = 'Hello, how "are" you?'
text = text.lower()
print(text)

#Remove all punctuation:
import string
text = 'Hello, how "are" you?'
for i in reversed(range(len(text))):
	if text[i] in string.punctuation:
		text = text[:i] + text[i+1:]
print(text)

#Split up text into separate words:
text = 'Hello, how "are" you?'
array = text.split(" ")
print(array)

#Remove all the most common english words from an array:
#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English
most_common_words = ["be", "have", "do", "dont", "say", "get", "make", "go", "know", "take", "see", "come", "think", "look", "want", "give", "use", "find", "tell", "ask", "work", "seem", "feel", "try", "leave", "call", "good", "new", "first", "last", "long", "great", "little", "own", "other", "old", "right", "big", "high", "different", "small", "large", "next", "early", "young", "important", "few", "public", "bad", "same", "able", "to", "of", "in", "for", "on", "with", "at", "by", "from", "up", "about", "into", "over", "after", "the", "and", "a", "that", "i", "me", "it", "not", "he", "as", "you", "this", "but", "his", "they", "her", "she", "or", "an", "will", "my", "one", "all", "would", "there", "their", "hi", "is", "was", "were", "am", "name", "who", "what", "where", "when", "why", "how"]
for i in reversed(range(len(array))):
	if array[i] in most_common_words:
		del array[i]

#Choose a random word from a list:
import random
word_list = ["bamboozle", "blue", "xbox"]
random.choice(word_list)

#This function returns the first word that is found in both lists
#of words
def matchingWords(list1, list2):
	'''Returns the first matching value in the two lists.
	Returns the empty string if there are no matches.'''
	for l in list1:
		if l in list2:
			return l
	return ""
