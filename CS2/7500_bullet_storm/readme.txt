For 800 points make a "bullet storm" style shooter game in which waves of 
enemies enter the screen from one direction and the player shoots them down 
while avoiding incoming fire.

You must use inheritance for this project. For example, player and enemy ships
should inherit from a common Ship class. Also the Ship and bullets should
inherit from a common Sprite class.

IMPORTANT: You can work in groups on this project, but before you begin coding 
you must share a project plan with the teacher that includes the pieces of the 
project that you will need to create, the order in which you will create them, 
and which group members will work on which piece. This plan can change but you
need to start somewhere.

I recommend using one of these image resources for the game:
