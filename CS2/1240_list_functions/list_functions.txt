#For 140 points, write the following functions.

'''Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the largest 
number in the list.'''


'''Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the second
largest number in the list.'''


'''Write a function that counts up and returns the number of vowels in 
a string. It can be useful to use "in" for this. For example:'''
vowels = 'aeiou'
if 'a' in vowels:
    print('Is a vowel.')
if 'c' in vowels:
    print('Is NOT a vowel.')


'''Write a function that counts up and returns the number of letter 
pairs in a string. A letter pair is any two adjacent letters with 
the same value.
"doggy" contains 1 letter pair.
"mississippi" contains 3 letter pairs.
The last letter in a pair can be used to create another new pair:
"aaaaaa" contains 5 letter pairs.'''


'''Write a function that counts up the number of unique values in a 
list. In order to do this, we need to remember what values have already 
been seen. A list of "seen before" values is perfect for this, just 
append unique values to the list and use "in" to check if the next value
is already in the list.'''


'''Write a function that creates and returns a list of 50 random 
numbers between 1 and 100 with no duplicates. There are many different
solutions to this problem. How quick and simple can you make your code?
Use your answer to the previous question to test to make sure your 
function works correctly.'''


'''Write a function that adds up the odd numbers in a list of numbers
and returns it.'''


'''Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns True if 
the number 2 occurs at least twice in the list.'''


'''Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns True if 
the number 2 occurs EXACTLY twice in the list.'''
