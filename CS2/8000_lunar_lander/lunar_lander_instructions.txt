For 800 points make a lunar lander game in which you have to safely direct
a lander to a safe landing site, like this:
http://moonlander.seb.ly/

IMPORTANT: You can work in groups on this project, but before you begin coding 
you must share a project plan with the teacher that includes the pieces of the 
project that you will need to create, the order in which you will create them, 
and which group members will work on which piece. This plan can change but you
need to start somewhere.

The following are recommendations and things to consider:

I recommend using Pygame's polygon drawing function to draw both the lander
and the lunar surface.

Write a function that returns the ground height at a given x value so you can
determine if the lander crashed.

Make sure you know how to use dx and dy velocity components. (Ask if this sounds
unfamiliar.)

Make sure you know how to use sine and cosine to implement "ballistic" controls.
For instance, if you lander has an angle of 45 degrees and fires its thrusters
then you should add   power*math.cos(45)   to dx and add   power*math.sin(45)
to dy each frame while the thrusters are firing, where power is some variable
determining the strength of the thrusters.
!ALSO! Python's math functions are in radians so you can't actually use 45, but
need to use math.pi/4 instead.
