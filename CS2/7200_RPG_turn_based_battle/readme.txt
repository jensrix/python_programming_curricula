For 500 points make a turn-based RPG battle simulator.

An example picture is in this same folder. Yours need not look the same.

You may work in groups of as many people as you would like but you 
must commit to the project so your group should all agree to the 
scope and size of the program you plan to make at the start. All 
students are eligible for 500 points each.

Before starting, create a Program Plan.
You must write down the pieces of the program that are needed AND in
what order it makes sense to work on the tasks. Each person in the 
group must work on one task at a time and you must keep track of who 
works on what tasks.

You must get approval for your Program Plan before writing code. Your
plan CAN change as the project progresses.

You will turn in your Program Plan and code.
