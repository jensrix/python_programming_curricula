For fun notes:
diablo like...
Enemy movement: move to player, move within distance of player (archers), circle strafe player, setup and dash to player's current location.
Enemy reactions to hit: temporary immunity, jumpback, spawn bullets, spawn weaker enemies, flee.
Curses: reduce speed, reduce defense, confuse (on players only. change key bindings), confuse on enemies causes them to temporarily target each other.
Spells (used by player or enemies): heal in area, healing bullet, reduce all cooldowns except for this spell, teleport to random enemies dealing damage to each, temporary invulnerability, phase (temporary no clip), dash attack while shoving, dash attack while phasing through, side dodge.
Spell delivery methods: hits circular location after a delay, is shot out like a bullet, follows mouse, seeks nearest target, straight line piercing, expanding outward from player, hits random enemy, explodes in place after timeout (like a mine), proximity mine, grenade, omni shot out from center, spread shot in an arc, contact lightning that chains through touching (or nearly touching) units.
Stats: hp, mass (determines who shoves and who gets shoved), defense (subtracted off of any recieved damage), hitbox radius, base damage (used to calculate spell damage).
Zoning: shove out, gravity to location, enemies target particular location.
Color matching aspect: what if you mix color matching game aspects with diablo-like gameplay so that you want to acquire the right elemental ability for the enemies present and then try to line them up or clump them up for the particular spell then you get bonuses for the number of same color enemies hit by a single blast or dash.
