ASTEROIDS: Making Asteroids

For 35 points, add to the code from earlier parts as described below.

Next we'll add some asteroids (still by reusing the polygon class).

Create a list of polygons and draw them on the screen at random 
locations. Make the number of angles and the radii random. Adjust the 
random numbers until the polygons look like lumpy polygon rocks.

Randomize the dx and dy values for the asteroids and call their move
functions in the main loop.

Lastly, when an asteroid leaves one side of the screen, it should appear 
on the opposite side. To make this happen, in the main loop, check each 
of your asteroid polygons and if the x,y coordinates of the asteroid
are offscreen, add the screen width or height to the appropriate x or y
value.
