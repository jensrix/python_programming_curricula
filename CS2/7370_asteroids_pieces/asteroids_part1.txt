ASTEROIDS: Polygons

This series of projects will teach you how to make the classic
arcade game Asteroids.

Step one is to learn how to use Pygame's draw.polygon function.

pygame.draw.polygon(window,blue,point_list)

window (often called screen or surface) is a variable referencing the window to draw the polygon on.

blue is a variable for the color, for example: (0,255,0)

point_list is a list of coordinates, for example: [(0,0),(100,50),(50,100)]

For 35 points, demonstrate your understanding of draw.polygon by drawing a hexagon and a five-pointed star with pygame.
