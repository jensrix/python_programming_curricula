Students should plan to create asteroids. Don't share any code with them. A lot of the process is them designing it themselves. You can talk to them about how to create wireframe objects. That might be a lesson that you give them.

This project should include some inheritance, which is implemented in your code.



Create a new file and then do the next step listed here.

Some next steps:
	-exploding with lines and "sparks" coming off the asteroid where the lines were formerly drawn.
	-points
	-3 lives
	-temporary invincibility after a death and at start of the game. can't shoot or collide during this time.
	-spread shot power up
	-enemy martian flies through
