ASTEROIDS: Bullets

For 70 points, add to your code as described below.

It's time for our ship to shoot.

Create a Bullet class in a new file, bullet.py. Bullet must inherit 
from Polygon.

Write similar code to what you wrote for asteroids. Create a list of 
bullets and loop through this list in the main loop to move each bullet.

In main.py, when a button, usually the space bar, is pressed, create a 
new bullet and add it to the bullet list.

How to move your bullets:
Suppose your player polygon is in a variable named player then the initial
dx and dy values for each new bullet should be set like this:
    new_bullet.dx = math.cos(player.angle)*bullet_speed
    new_bullet.dy = math.sin(player.angle)*bullet_speed
where bullet_speed is a variable you create that determines how fast the bullets travel.

Bullets should be removed from the game after a while. Open up bullet.py 
and add a new variable, self.timeout, to the Bullet class. Initialize
this variable to the number of frames that a bullet should last before
being removed from the game. Then in the main loop, decrease each bullet's
timeout and check if the timeout is below zero. If so, remove the bullet.
You will need to reverse your loop. Something like this:

    for i in reversed(range(len(bullets))):
        #Move bullets[i]

        #Reduce the timer on bullets[i]

        #Delete bullets[i] if its timer is less than zero
