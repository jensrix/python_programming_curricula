This worked well.

Make sure to act out the general concept and the particular function that students are implementing.



These would go great with the step-thru debugger.
The day 1 project is very challenging for some students.
These need to go in conjuction with something that the advanced students can work on when they finish early.



Consider putting all the testing code together in one so students can piece together all the functions at their own pace and gradually see their scores go up.


Student questions:

What is this good for?
A: This is a simple data structure more commonly used back when computer memory was more limited. It was used to build more complicated data structures. The lists that we use are built on simpler data structures like this linked list.

Can't we just write the code with a list?
A: No. The whole point is to figure this out without using lists. Why? For practice and learning.



Note: the Day 1 assignment (addToTail) has a nice recursive solution. You should let students use that option if they want.
