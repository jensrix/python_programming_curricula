The 5 Letter Game is played as follows:
Player one picks a 5 letter word.
Player two guesses 5 letter words and player one says how many of the letters in player two's word show up in player one's word. (It doesn't matter how many times the letter shows up.)

For example:
Player one's word is start.
Player two guesses: apple
One letter appears in player one's word.
Player two guesses: strap
Four letters appear in player one's word.

A longer example is given at the end of this document.

For 50 points write a version of this game where the computer chooses a secret word then the player has to guess what it is. The computer gives feedback on how many letters match the user's guess and the secret word.

For 200 points, write a program that plays the game and attempts to guess the secret word. You do not get credit for writing a "brute force" player that just guesses randomly.


BIG EXAMPLE (with some strategy):

The secret word is stove.

Guess: worst
Three letters appear in both words
Guess: woven
Three letters appear in both words
(After this I could have tried stone to get a lot more information, but I was still bad at this game.)
Guess: xerox
Two letters appear in both words
Guess: apple
One letters appear in both words
Guess: earth
Two letters appear in both words
Guess: stare
Three letters appear in both words
Guess: store
Four letters appear in both words
Guess: stair
Two letters appear in both words
(This tells me that the two letters in store that are not in stair have to be in the word.)
Guess: abbey
One letters appear in both words
Guess: stole
Four letters appear in both words
Guess: guess
Three letters appear in both words
Guess: tents
Five letters appear in both words
