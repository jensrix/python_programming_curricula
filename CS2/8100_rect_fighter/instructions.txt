For 800 points create a "rectangle fighter" game in which two rectangular 
players fight. This is an exercise in using hitboxes. See the associated image
in which player 1's fist box is about to hit player 2's torso box.

IMPORTANT: You can work in groups on this project, but before you begin coding 
you must share a project plan with the teacher that includes the pieces of the 
project that you will need to create, the order in which you will create them, 
and which group members will work on which piece. This plan can change but you
need to start somewhere.

Use Pygame's colliderect function to easily check if two rectangles collided.

You should consider the movement, combat, and damage models you want your game
to have. For instance:
	Movement: Will there be jumping, sliding, crouching?
	Combat: Will there be punches as well as kicks? Tackles? Throws? Ranged attacks?
	Damage: Will head hits cause more damage? Can leg damage slow a player?

I have some super nintendo controllers that we can hook up to your game so 
consider how gameplay might work well particularly for the controller in
the image in this folder.
