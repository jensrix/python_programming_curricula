and answer the following questions and email them to your teacher with the subject line: "CS2: quicksort video".

1) What is the pivot used for in the Quicksort algorithm?

2) What's the best initial pivot to use when sorting the following list?
[7,1,2]

3) What's the best initial pivot to use when sorting the following list?
[55,2,87,94,26,15,1]

4) What's the best initial pivot to use when sorting the following list?
[8,3,6,7,3,2,6,4,3]

5) What are the 4 different ways to choose a pivot?

6) What is good about using the median as the pivot?

7) What is bad about using the median as the pivot?

8) Write a partition function that
    A) Takes one argument, a list.
	B) Randomly chooses a pivot from the list
	C) Separates the remaining list values into two lists, one for values less than the pivot and one for values greater than the pivot.
This is basically the algorithm demonstrated in the very first card demonstration of quicksort.

9) What is the part of Quicksort that varies?

10) In Lomuto's partition, index j is used to iterate through the list to make sure we compare all the values to the pivot. What is index i used for?

11) What is the purpose of the final swap in Lomuto's partition?

12) What is strange about the movement of the index in Hoare's partition, as demonstrated in the dancing example of Quicksort?

13) How can Quicksort and other divide and conquer algorithms make use of multiple processors?

14) How many while loops does Hoare's partition algorithm use?

15) How does the worst case time complexity of Quicksort compare to Bubblesort and Insertionsort?

16) What is the average/best case time complexity of Quicksort?

17) I want to sort n=100 values. How much better is n*log(n) compared to n*n. (Use a calculator and subtract the two values.)

18) What is Big O of 5*log(n)?
In other words O(5*log(n)) = ?

19) What is Big O of n*log(n) + log(n)?
In other words O(n*log(n) + log(n)) = ?

20) Quicksort is not stable. Why not?
