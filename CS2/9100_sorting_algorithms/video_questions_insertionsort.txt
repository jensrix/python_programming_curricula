and answer the following questions and email them to your teacher with the subject line: "CS2: insertion sort video".

1) What's always going to be true of insertion sort?

2) Why doesn't insertion sort start with the first value in the list?

3) The two loops in bubble sort both move left to right through the list to be sorted. What directions do the insertion sort loops move?

4) How does insertion sort compare to bubble sort? (I want at least a three sentence answer.)

5) What is Big O of 4n^3+7n^2+2n^6?
In other words O(4n^3+7n^2+2n^6) = ?

6) What is Big O of 3^n+2^n?
In other words O(3^n+2^n) = ?

7) What is the worst case time complexity for insertion sort?

8) How much extra computer memory does insertion sort use?

9) Insertion sort does not swap values the way bubble sort does. What does insertion sort do instead?

10) How many comparisons does it take insertion sort to sort the cards at the end?
