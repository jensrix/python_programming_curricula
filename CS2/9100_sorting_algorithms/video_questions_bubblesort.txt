and answer the following questions and email them to your teacher with the subject line: "CS2: bubble sort video".

1) The reason the inner loop of bubblesort loops to len(xs)-1 is so we don't run off the end of the list when comparing xs[i] and xs[i+1]. What error would we get if we looped to len(xs)?

2) Why does the first geeksforgeeks bubblesort code loop to n-i-1 instead of n-1?
(Reminder: n is the length of the list.)

3) What is the optimization in the optimized geeksforgeeks bubblesort code?

4) Describe Big O notation in your own words.

5) What is Big O of 5n^3+6n+8?
In other words O(5n^3+6n+8) = ?

6) What is Big O of 4n^9+6^n?
In other words O(4n^9+6^n) = ?

7) What is the worst case time complexity for bubblesort?

8) How much extra computer memory does bubble sort use?

9) Does bubble sort copy the list values to a new location when sorting?

10) Is there a possibility that bubblesort will swap equal values that are adjacent?

11) How many cards are in the list at the end?

12) How many comparisons does it take to sort the cards at the end?
