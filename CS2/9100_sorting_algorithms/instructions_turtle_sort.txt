TURTLE DANCE SORTS
Holt has written a program in which turtles "dance" an insertion sort to sort themselves by size. You can download the code here:

For 100 to 200 points, depending on the difficulty of the sort and quality of the code, modify Holt's code to have the turtles perform a different sort (they cannot perform bubble sort or insertion sort).
