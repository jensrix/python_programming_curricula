For 35 points, answer the following questions about the Python files:
shooting_at_mouse_bad.py
and
shooting_at_mouse_good.py

Run both Python programs. Use the arrow keys to move. Click on the screen to 
shoot.

Both Python files define a class named Square that is used to create player
and bullet objects. 


1. What are some similarities and differences between the class Square in 
shooting_at_mouse_bad.py compared to the class Square in 
shooting_at_mouse_good.py?


2. Try to shoot (clicking on the screen with the mouse) at angles of 0, 20, 
and 45 degrees from the player square in both the good and bad files. How
does the shooting at these angles compare in the two programs?


3. Compare and contrast the three lines of code immediately following the
comment   #Move and draw all the bullets   in the two files.


4. Print out the value of b.rect.x in the loop below #Move and draw all the bullets
and compare it to the printed value of b.x in the other file. What difference
do you notice?


5. Explain the connection between the answer to number 4 and the behavior
you noticed in number 2. If you get stuck, the comment at the top of 
shooting_at_mouse_bad.py will help.
