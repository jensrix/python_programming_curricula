========== DAY 1

Welcome everybody.

Shuffle the class, get to know someone new. What did they do over the summer? What are they excited or nervous about this year? Learn a name.

Have people share something learned about neighbor.

Introduce the class, what's new, what's the same.

Students list up to 8 people they'd like to sit near. There will be assigned seating.

Then students form groups of 2 or 3 and try to write better instructions on some scrap paper.

(Perhaps suggest sub instructions for what it means to get something out of a jar, or to spread using a knife, essentially a function.)
