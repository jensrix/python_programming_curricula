Follow this tutorial to create a bootable Raspberry pi drive on a microSD card (I think you can also do it on a flash drive which is probably cheaper and easier).

SKIP down to "The files and programs needed to create the SD card"

(Also, if you have it on a flash drive, can any PC boot from the flash drive and then simulate the raspberry pi minecraft?)

You should not need to format the drive while following the tutorial though my PC asked me multiple times if I wanted to and then when I said yes it made the microSD card write only and I had to download this utility

to re-re-format and remove the formatting before it would work.
