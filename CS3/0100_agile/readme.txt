============ TO BUY

Stuff to buy: big board of paper (giant post its you can stick up), you can get little post its from the supply room.

============ TO TURN IN

Students must cite all sources, track who has done what, and turn in their daily scrum 3 questions.

============ VISION

Brainstorming at the start individually.
Categorize/group up ideas.
Determine priorities in terms of importance.
Decompose tasks into actionable items. Sometimes the next action is to look something up, experiment with an idea, or come up with the next actionable tasks.

Start each day with scrum meeting (should be quick, like 5 min total for everyone to write and speak). Turn in did, will do, obstacles daily (maybe digitally?).
Make sure everyone has post-its in their doing column (maybe also their review column). Do reviews first.
Then everyone works individually on their doing task until they think it's complete, another student reviews the code.

At end of period on first few days, you might have them reflect on how well it went.

============ DOWNLOADED DOCUMENTS

	Digital Scrum Board.pptx
This contains template for post its and boards needed for scrum and backlog. Do this stuff on whiteboard probably, or get one of those big sheets of paper they use in board meetings.

	Daily Scrum Meeting.docx
Open scrum board and backlog. Make sure everyone has a post it in their doing column. If not, put something from backlog into it.
Each person answers: What you did last class, what you will do today, what obstacles are in your way

	Individual Scrum List.docx
Priority, actionable task, owner, estimated time, date completed

	Scrum Simulation.docx
What it sounds like. Good idea. Not my favorite execution. I like the retrospective though.

	Team WorkFlow.docx
Priority, actionable task, owner, estimated time, date completed
What we did last class, what we will do today, what obstacles are in our way

============ NOTES

https://learningandteachingblog.com/2019/06/19/group-work-that-works-agile-for-authentic-learning/
In Scrum, students begin by creating a product backlog, where they break down their long-term project into smaller deliverable products that could be considered complete on their own. From there, students prioritize these products and build their first sprint by breaking down the highest priority items into actionable tasks that comprise their sprint backlog. From there, students get to work. 
During a sprint (typically lasting from three to five class periods), students tackle the actionable tasks in their sprint backlog. Each student selects one task at a time and pursues completion of that task with laser focus until it is done. Upon completion, they move the task to Review, where it will be signed off by another team member before being deemed “Done.” The student then chooses another task, and the process continues throughout the course of the sprint.

A key Agile principle is to work on “incremental product development, delivering frequently in weeks, rather than months”.
For this reason, at Laboratoria, instead of having a traditional grading system, we have a points-and-reward system. Students start at zero points and earn points as they go.
Students earn points in three distinctive ways:
1. Points for effort: students are rewarded for completing certain activities, (like providing feedback to a peer) whether they do it well or not. These points value effort, not performance.
2. Points for performance: students also earn points for doing well certain activities. The better they do it, the more points they earn. This is typically the case of Problem Sets, where to earn the full amount of points, students must correctly solve the problem AND demonstrate having used best coding practices.
3. Points for outstanding work: students also earn points for demonstrating outstanding behavior in certain areas, like teamwork, communication and any other behavior teachers want to foster.
