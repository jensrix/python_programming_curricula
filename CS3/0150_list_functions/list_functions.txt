#For 70 points, write the following functions.

'''Write a function that take a list and returns True if the list 
contains 3 of same value in a row. Hint: Use a loop within a loop.'''


'''Write a function to sum up and return the even digits of a number. 
Check your function with the following.'''
if sumEvenDigits(2678) == 16:
    print('correct')
if sumEvenDigits(853521) == 10:
    print('correct')


'''Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the two
numbers that are closest together. Test your code with the following.'''
pair = getClosest([15,12,7,2,1,9,4])
if (pair[0]==1 and pair[1]==2) or (pair[0]==2 and pair[1]==1):
    print('correct')
pair = getClosest([15,12,7,2,12,9,4])
if pair[0]==12 and pair[1]==12:
    print('correct')


'''The animals array contains a list of strings that are the names of animals. For example:'''
animals = ["lizard", "duck", "duck", "goose", "duck", "lizard"]
'''Write a function that prints out the total number of ducks and 
separately prints the total number of ducks and geese combined.
Your function should only use one loop!'''
