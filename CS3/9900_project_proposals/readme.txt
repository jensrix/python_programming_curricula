For 35 points per day, you can propose and follow through on your own 
project. You may work in groups of as many people as you like.
All group members are eligible for 35 points per day.

Each day all group members must turn in a Scrum sheet and must be 
following Agile methodology. For each day that a Scrum sheet is not 
turned in, or group members are goofing off, they will not recieve 
their daily points.

Projects and groups must get teacher approval before starting.
