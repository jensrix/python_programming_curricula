For 100 points, create a program that determines the 10 numbers 
that maximize the output of the well-named functionToMaximize
function. You may only use 100,000 comparisons (calls of an if 
statement) to find this optimal list of 10 numbers.
In other words, your outer loop should be a for loop that 
repeats 100,000 times.

You should include comments, how you create your initial list of 
numbers, a function that modifies or mutates your list, and at the
end you should print out the value you get out of the 
functionToMaximize as well as your best list of inputs.

Consider changing the size of the mutation operator and/or the number
of mutations that occur per round as you progress.
