For 800 points, create your own neural network that uses matrix
multiplication for significant speed gains over the provided
neural network, then train your network to recognize the handwritten
digits (basically the second part means "do the basic assignment").

This sequence of videos discusses neural networks in great detail and
uses the specific dataset we are using as an example:
