To see what the data looks like, run visualizer.py and press any key
to see the next image.

Examples of how to read in the data can be found in visualizer.py

Examples of how to create and run the neural network can be found at
the bottom of neural_net_draft08.py

You must turn in well-commented code as well as clear notes about the 
decisions you made regarding the size and shape of your network,
how much time was spent training, and the learning rate you used.
