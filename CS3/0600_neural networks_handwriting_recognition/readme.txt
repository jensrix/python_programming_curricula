These are perfect and talk exactly about your dataset. They are in order:

First video:

The first video explains bias at around 11:30.
It mentions that the outputs are all between zero and one. I think your NN's outputs are frequently outside that range... suspicious.
At 14min weighted sum can be calculated at a matrix*vector product. This is probably much more efficient than current implementation! Oops.

Second video:

Cost function is discussed at 3:30. It is the same as the one you wrote... I think. They did a mean-squared error thing.
At 13:15 his neural net gets around 95% correctness!
