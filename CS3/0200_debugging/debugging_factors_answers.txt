This is not a project for points. This is the program that I used for the debugging video.


Find factors of a number: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/factor-number


Bug ideas for the following program:
Delete the + 1  in  for i in range(1, x + 1):
Reverse x and i in if x % i == 0:
input not converted to an int
typo in the function name


# Python Program to find the factors of a number
# define a function
def printFactors(x):
    # This function takes a number and prints the factors
    print("The factors of",x,"are:")
    #Loop from 1 to x, including both.
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        #Check if x is divisible by i
        if x % i == 0:
            #print i, if i is a factor of x
            print(i)
# change this value for a different result.
num = 320
# uncomment the following line to take input from the user
#num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
printFactors(num)
