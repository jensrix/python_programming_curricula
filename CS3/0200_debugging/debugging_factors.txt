This is not a project for points. This is the program that I used for the debugging video.

Computer Science 2/1250_debugging

The program is supposed to print all the factors of any number that 
you give to it. If you give it 60, it should print out 
1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,30,60

Unfortunately the program has bugs in it. All the comments are correct,
but not all of the code does what the comments say.

# Python Program to find the factors of a number

# define a function
def printFactrs(x):
    # This function takes a number and prints the factors
    print("The factors of",x,"are:")
    #Loop from 1 to x, including both.
    for i in range(1, x):
        #Check if x is divisible by i
        if i % x == 0:
            #print i, if i is a factor of x
            print(i)

#Get input from the user
num = input("Enter a number: ")
printFactors(num)
