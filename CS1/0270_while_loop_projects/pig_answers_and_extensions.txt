Game of pig

The rules are simple: Two players race to reach 100 points. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the turn total). At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions:

Choice is roll or hold:

roll - If the player rolls a
		1: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's turn.
	2 - 6: the number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn continues.
hold - The turn total is added to the player's score and it becomes the opponent's turn.
