For 100 points, write a program that lets two players or one player
against the computer play the game of pig.

The rules are simple: Two players race to reach 100 points. Each turn, 
a player chooses roll or hold. If they roll a 1, their turn is over
and their temporary score is reset to zero. If they roll anything else, 
the value they rolled is added to a temporary score. If they choose 
hold, their temporary score is added to their true score

roll - If the player rolls a
		1: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's turn.
	2 - 6: the number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn continues.
hold - The turn total is added to the player's score and it becomes the opponent's turn.
