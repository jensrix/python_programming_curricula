For 100 points, write a program that is very simlar to the 
'Choose Your Own Adventure' project you may have done earlier, but 
this time the character you choose has attributes such as strength,
intelligence, and dexterity that affect the abilities that the
character uses.

Here is an example from a Text Adventure I wrote. Yours can and should
be quite different.

You CAN take your old 'Choose Your Own Adventure' project and modify it.

>What is your name, adventurer?
Trogdor
>Choose a difficulty. 1: hard. 2: medium. 3: easy.
2
>Trogdor has 7 health and 9 magic.
>Your strength is 3
>Your intelligence is 4
>Your dexterity is 4

>Welcome, Trogdor. Do you dare cross the treacherous sea (1), delve the dangerous dungeon (2), or climb the majestic mountain (3)?
1
>A tentacled sea monster rises from the depths and attacks your ship.
>The monster looks angry. It slaps you with a tentacle for 4 damage.
>1: Cast a fire spell. 2. Shoot it with an arrow. 3. Stab it with your sword.
1
>The sea monster writhes in pain.
>The monster looks angry. It slaps you with a tentacle for 5 damage.
>1: Cast a fire spell. 2. Shoot it with an arrow. 3. Stab it with your sword.
2
>The sea monster is barely bothered by your arrows.
>The monster drags you down to a watery grave.
>Better luck next time.
