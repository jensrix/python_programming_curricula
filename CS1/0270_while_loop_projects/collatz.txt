For 35 points, write a program that prints out the Collatz sequence
for any number given to it.

The Collatz sequence, also called the Hailstone sequence, is a sequence
of numbers relevant to the Collatz conjecture, which theorizes that any
number using this algorithm will eventually be reduced to 1.

To get a Collatz sequence from a number, if the number is even, divide 
it by two, and if it's odd, multiply it by three and add one. 
Continue the operation on the result of the previous operation until the 
number becomes 1.

Example of a Collatz sequence for the number 25:
