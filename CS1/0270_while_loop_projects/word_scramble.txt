For 35 points, write a program that scrambles the letters of a word, 
prints the scrambled word then asks the user to guess the unscrambled 
word. The program should repeat until the user gets it right.

Start your program off with the following code:
'''

import random

original_word = "a t t a c k"

#Scramble a copy of the word and convert it back to a string
scrambled_word = original_word.split()
random.shuffle(scrambled_word)
scrambled_word = "".join(scrambled_word)

#Remove spaces from the original word
original_word = "".join(original_word.split())

'''
