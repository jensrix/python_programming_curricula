For 70 points, write a program that draws a square, then separately
draws a pentagon, then separately draws an octagon. Use loops.
THEN write a function that takes two arguments, a turtle and the 
number of sides, then uses the turtle to draw a shape with the given
number of sides.

You will need to figure out what angle to turn your turtles at based on 
the number of sides. In fact, you want the angle to be 360 divided by 
the number of sides.
