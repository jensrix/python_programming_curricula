#1. Write a program to print the sum of 3 and 27 without using the number 30.

#2. Write a program to calculate 946 minus 712 then print the result.

#3. Write a program to divide 100 by 20 then print the result.

#4. Write a program to multiple 2 times 8 then print the result.

#5. Write a program to divide 144 by 9 then print the result.

#6. Write a program to divide 36 by 7 then print the result.

#7. Write a program to multiply 86 by 112 then print the result.

#8. Write a program to first multiply 7 by 4 and then subtract 9 then print the result.

'''9. Swapping variable values is harder than you might think.
Write the indicated code after each comment:'''
#Create a variable named a and give it the value 8

#Create a variable named b and give it the value 4

#Print a and b

#Create a variable named temp and set it equal to the value of a

#Set a equal to the value of b

#Set b equal to the value of temp

#Print a and b


'''10. The previous question gave a correct implementation of swapping 
two variable values. What does the following broken version of swap 
print and why doesn't it work?'''
a = 8
b = 4
print(a)
print(b)
a = b
b = a
print(a)
print(b)


'''11. variable replacement: If a variable name appears anywhere in 
your program other than to the left of an equals sign, the program will 
replace the name with the variable's value.
What does this program print?
'''
x = 100
print(x)
'''The x in print(x) is replaced by its value. The program above has the 
same output as'''
print(100)


#Consider the program:
x = 9
x = x+1
print(x)
'''In math this would make no sense:
x = x+1
If we subtract x from both sides we get:
0 = 1
This is impossible.

In programming x = x + 1 is no problem. Whenever x appears anywhere 
other than to the left of an equals sign, it gets replaced with its value so
x = x+1 becomes
x = 9+1 becomes
x = 10
then
print(x) becomes
print(10)

12. What does this program print?'''
x = 9
x = x+1
print(x)
