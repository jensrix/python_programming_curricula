'''
For 140 points, write and test a function that takes two lists of
ones and zeroes representing binary numbers and returns the sum
as another binary number.

For example:
[1,0,1] + [0,1,1] = [1,0,0,0]
but the code you will use to test your function will look more like this:
'''
bin1 = [1,0,1]
bin2 = [0,1,1]
result = binaryAdder(bin1, bin2)
print(result) #Prints [1,0,0,0]
