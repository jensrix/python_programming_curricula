#For 35 points, answer the following questions.

#1: Everything in a computer is represented by a number. Run the 
#following code, then guess what is printed by print(ord('d))
x = ord('a')
y = ord('b')
z = ord('c')
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)


#2: Write a program that prints the first 4 numbers representing 
#the first 4 letters of your name.


#3: The ord() function converts symbols into 
#numbers. Guess what the chr() function does based on
#the following code.
x = ord('p')
y = ord('q')
z = ord('r')
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
print(chr(x))
print(chr(y))
print(chr(z))


#4: All information in a computer is stored as 
#a number. Those numbers are represented by ones and 
#zeroes. The following program converts a binary number
#to a traditional decimal number. Change the list of
#ones and zeroes until you can represent the number 9
binary = [1,0,1,1]
x=0
for i in reversed(range(len(binary))):
    x = x+ binary[i] * 2**i
print(x)


'''5: Binary addition. Consider the following pattern then answer 
the question below.
0  + 1 =   1
1  + 1 =  10
10 + 1 =  11
10 +10 = 100
10 +11 = 101
101+ 1 = 110
What does this sum equal?
11 + 1 = ?
