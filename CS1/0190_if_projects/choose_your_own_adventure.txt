'''

For 50 points, write a "Choose Your Own Adventure Game" program that
tells a story and lets the user decide what the character does next.

You should use NESTED if statements for this program. If you don't 
know what I mean, check out the 20 questions game.

By the way, you can always use the lower() function to convert a 
string to lowercase:'''

text = "Hi ThErE"
text = text.lower()
print(text)

'''Interaction with your program might look like the following:
>What is your name, adventurer?
Neal
>Welcome, Neal. Do you dare cross the treacherous sea (1), delve the dangerous dungeon (2), or climb the majestic mountain (3)?
1
>You board a ship and set sail, but a storm blows you off course.
>Do you curse Neptune (1), stow the sails (2), or drop anchor (3)?
1
>The sea god rises from the depths and smites you with his trident.
>You die.
