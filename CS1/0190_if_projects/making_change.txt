For 100 points, write a program that asks the user how much 
the bill was for, then asks the user how many dollars they gave 
the cashier. The program should then calculate and print out the 
number of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies that the 
user should get in change.

You might find this webpage useful:
learnpython.trinket.io/learn-python-part-1-numbers#/numbers/modulus
but you can also use if statements to write this program without
using modulus.

If you get stuck try:
1. Doing some examples on paper and analyzing the process.
2. Work step by step first pretending your only change can be in
dollars and pennies
then dollars, quarters, and pennies
then dollars, quarters, dimes, and pennies
and so on. Make sure the code works at each step.

Interaction with your program might look like the following:
>How much is the bill?
21.53
>How many dollars will you give the cashier?
22
>You will receive $0.47 in the form of
>0 dollars
>1 quarters
>2 dimes
>0 nickels
>2 pennies
