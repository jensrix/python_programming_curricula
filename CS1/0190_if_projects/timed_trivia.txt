For 50 points, write a timed trivia game. 

Use if statements to check if the user got the question right.

Give bonus points if the user answers within a certain time limit.
The user must answer BOTH correctly and quickly to get the maximum points.

Print the number of points earned at the end of the trivia game.
Ask at least 3 trivia questions.

Here is example code showing how to figure out the elapsed time:
'''
import time

print("What is the capital of Australia?")
start = time.time()
answer = input()
end = time.time()
print("The correct answer is Canberra")
print("You took "+str(end-start)+" seconds to answer.")
