Assignment:
Write a program that gets the zombie to the flower in #19. Copy the code in the space provided then complete the following questions.

The function named notFinished() is not clearly named. Rename this function to make it easier to understand.

Sketch a different maze for which this program would also work. 

Draw the path the zombie would take in this maze.

Sketch a different maze for which this program would fail.

Draw the path the zombie would take.

Describe in words the types of mazes that your algorithm works in. In other words, what feature does a maze need to have for your algorithm to work in it?

Describe in words the types of mazes that your algorithm fails in. In other words, what feature does a maze need to have for your algorithm to fail in it?

Modify your algorithm to work in the types of mazes it previously failed in. Write the code here. Leave space for comments:

Lastly, include comments describing the purpose of each loop and if-else statement. Why are these structures needed to make the program work.




Notes:
You can show the students #6 and #7.
Make sure they see the code.
You could demonstrate a maze with #14
#15 is better.
#16 is the exact same thing in the other direction, but maybe that's good for the students to do one.
#17 is exactly the same as #15.
#18 uses if-else
#19 uses if-else in same way but turns other direction.
#20 basically does create the general maze runner, but it gives away too much of the code.

For what types of mazes does your algorithm work?
For what types of mazes does your algorithm fail?

What comments would you add to this code?
Are the function names clear?
//Move forward until you run out of path, then turn right and try again.
//Repeat all this until a flower is reached.
while (notFinished())
{
  if (isPathForward())
  {
    moveForward();
  }
  else
  {
    turnRight();
  }
}
