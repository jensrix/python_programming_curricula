'''

For 50 points, write a "Game of 20 Questions" program that tries to figure
out what the user is thinking of. You don't need to use 20 questions. That
would take a long time.

You MUST have at least 16 answers in your game of 20 questions.

Start with the following example.

You should use NESTED if statements for this program. Try out the 
following program to see what I mean:'''

answer = input('Is it a physical object?').lower()
if answer == 'yes' or answer == 'y':
    answer = input('Is it alive?').lower()
    if answer == 'yes' or answer == 'y':
        answer = input('Is it an animal?').lower()
        if answer == 'yes' or answer == 'y':
			print("It's a dog, right?")
		else:
			print("It's a tree, right?")
	else:
		print("It's a rock, right?")
else:
	print("It's the concept of love, right?")

'''By the way, you can always use the lower() function to convert a string to
lowercase:'''

text = "Hi ThErE"
text = text.lower()
print(text)

'''Interaction with your program might look like the following:
>Is it a physical object?
Yes
>Is it alive
y
>Is it an animal?
no
>Is it a plant
no
>Are you thinking of Ecoli?
