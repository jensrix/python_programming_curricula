For 35 points, write code that solves each of the following problems.

You will need to use slicing which you can learn more about here:
https://learnpython.trinket.io/learn-python-part-4-changing-text#/changing-text/slicing

Note: This tutorial uses Python2, but we, cutting edge people that we
are, use Python3. One big difference is that this works in Python2
print "hello"
but in Python3 you have to say
print("hello")

1. Use slicing to get subordinate out of insubordinate

2. Use slicing to get fun out of fundamental

3. Use slicing to get thematic out of mathematics

4. Use slicing to get put out of computer

5. Use slicing to get nova out of innovation

6. Write a line of code that turns the string "san francisco" into 
"San Francisco". You can type "san francisco" as many times as you need
but no other strings.
Hint: the capitalize() function will help you out. For example:
name = "neal"
print(name.capitalize())
