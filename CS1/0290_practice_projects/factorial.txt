For 18 points, write a program that asks the user for a number
then calculates and prints the factorial of that number.

The factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number.

For example, the factorial of 6 (denoted as 6!) is 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720. Factorial is not defined for negative numbers and the factorial of zero is one, 0! = 1.
