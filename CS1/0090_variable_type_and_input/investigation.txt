For 8 points, answer the following questions.



#1. What is the name of the error you get if you try to run this line of code?
print("4"+2)

'''Python can be picky about what you can and canâ€™t do with different types of data. 
Luckily Python gives us functions that will try to convert between types.

int()
str()
float()

There are many different types. For now we will only deal with integers (positive 
and negative whole numbers), floats (decimals), and string (text).

The following code converts "4" to a number, then adds 4 to 2, then prints the results:'''
print(int("4")+2)

'''Write Python code to perform the following conversion and print 
the result then write what is printed or write what the error is if there 
is an error.'''

#2. Convert "10" to an int
#3. Convert "3.14" to a float
#4. Convert 42 to a string
#5. Convert 10 to a float
#6. Convert 3.14 to an int
#7. Convert "hello" to a float

#If you're getting the speed of a vehicle, the type of the speed would be a float.
#If you want to know a person's age, you're interested in an integer type.
#If you want to know who wrote Moby Dick, the answer has type string.

#8. Run the following program then write one sentence saying what it does:
response = input("How old are you?")
age = int(response)
age = age+1
print('Next year you will be '+str(age)+' years old.')

#9. What error does the following program throw?
response = input("How old are you?")
age = age+1
print('Next year you will be '+str(age)+' years old.')

'''The int, float, and str functions are particularly useful when 
using input because input will always return a string.

For example, if I want to ask the user what grade out of 100 
they got on the test so I can add 5 bonus points to it, I would 
have to use one of the following programs:'''

#Program A
grade = input("What was your score?")
grade = float(grade)+5
print(grade)

#or

#Program B
grade = float(input("What was your score?"))
grade = grade+5
print(grade)

#or

#Program C
grade = float(input("What was your score?"))+5
print(grade)

#10. Which of the above 3 program options makes the most sense to you?
#11. Write one good thing and one bad thing about each program above.
