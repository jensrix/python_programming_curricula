#For 5 points, answer the following questions.



'''Code runs in order from top to bottom.
1. Put the following code 
in the correct order.'''
print("name")
print("[insert your name]")
print("my")
print("is")


'''print and exit are standard, built-in functions. Other functions we
have to ask for in order to use. import is how we request code.
2. Run the following program and figure out what time.sleep does.'''
import time
print("I'm")
time.sleep(1)
print("so")
time.sleep(1)
print("sleepy.")

'''3. What error do you get if you capitalize import?'''

'''4. What error do you get if you call time.sleep(1) without first importing?'''

'''sleep is a function (or action) that belongs to time.
dot means belongs.

Every function is written as a word followed by parentheses
Functions are action verbs followed by parentheses.
print() is a function.

Sometimes we put something inside the parentheses to tell the function how to do its job.
sleep(2) #rest for 2 seconds

5. Can you tell the program to sleep for a decimal amount of time?
6. What about a fractional amount of time?'''

'''If you accidentally type time.sleep(1000) into your program, you can end the program early by clicking on the red square button that appears while a program is running.
7. Test this out and determine the name of the error that you get.'''
