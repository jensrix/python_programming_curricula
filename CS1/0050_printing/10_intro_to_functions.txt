#For 5 points, answer the following questions.


'''Programming has variables, but they aren't exactly the same as math variables.
Figure out what's going on here.
1. Does this do what you expect? What did you expect?'''
x = 4
print(4)
print("4")
print(x)
print("x")

'''Run this program then re-order the lines of code and run it again.
2. What does exit do?'''
print("My name is")
exit()
print("Neal")

'''print and exit are standard, built-in functions.
Other built in functions include:

print(type())
print(int())
print(str())
print(len())

Put each of the following in the parentheses of each the above functions 
and write down the result. Some of these will cause an error. Write down 
the name of the error. There are 4 functions above and 4 inputs below. That 
means you should end up with 16 total answers. Number these questions 3 
through 18.

"hello"

"42"
