Discuss the error messages we have found so far and how to read and interpret them.

Then talk briefly about strings. Printing 5 versus "5". Printing calendar versus "calendar"



Discuss using sets of print functions. Broken up by calls to sleep.

Words and letters:

Strings: Computer scientists have a special word for text: strings. It's an old term – dating back to printing presses in the late 1890s! – that came about because all words are made up of letters that have been "strung together."

Strings are surrounded by single or double quotes. If you don't use them or you forget one of them then you get a ParseError. But specifically you may get a name error, for example if you just type Jack and hit enter. Or you might get a Syntax error if you forget one quotation mark.

My challenge: how to make a string with the words Jack's Hippocampus using the apostrophe. What about a string with air quotes such as 'a sophisticated heat beam, which we called a "laser"'?



Import lets you...
Use other people’s code!
Use code from a different python file.


In python . (period) means possessive, like an apostrophe s.

English:
	holt's classroom
Python:
	holt.classroom

Dot '.' means belongs to

Q Translate the following into English:
neal.walk()
A Imperative: Walk, Neal.

Q List two functions you know:
A print and sleep


random.randint()
Random's randint function

turtle.getX()
turtle's getX function

rect.width
rect's width attribute


In python parentheses at the end of a word means do that word, take an action.

Go to the store, Neal.
neal.goToStore()
or perhaps neal.goTo(store)
