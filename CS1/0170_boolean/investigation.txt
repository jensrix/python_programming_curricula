Challenges (these also appear on the webpage):

1. Use the console below to type four "less than or greater than" math problems. Two should return True and two should return False.

2. Above, in the sample problems, we used the == symbol. What do you think it means? Try using it in the console below with different numbers on either side, until you think you've got a sense for it.

Challenges (these also appear on the webpage):

Use the console above to create:

1. A boolean expression that includes the "greater than" symbol
2. A boolean expression that includes the "less than" symbol
3. A boolean expression that includes the "greater than or equal to" symbol
4. A boolean expression that includes the "less than or equal to" symbol
5. A boolean expression that includes the "equivalent" symbol
6. A boolean expression that includes the "not equivalent" symbol

Challenges (these also appear on the webpage):

Read through the boolean problems below and try to figure out what Python will return. Run each in the console below if you like.

1. True and False
2. True or False
3. (True or False) and True
4. (True or False) and True
5. not False or True
6. not True and False
7. not True or False
8. not True or True
9. 3 + 3 == 6 and len("hi!") == 3
10. 3 + 3 == 6 or len("hi!") == 3
11. 3 + 3 != 6 or len("hi!") == 3
12. 4 + 4 > 2 and 4 != 5
