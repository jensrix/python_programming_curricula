For 35 points, write a program that asks the user for nouns, verbs, 
adjectives, and adverbs, then uses these words to fill in a MadLib.

NOTE: You must use comments to indicate the section of code where 
input is being retrieved from the user and separately the section 
where the MadLib is printed.

>He's a chilled koala, a watchful sidewalk gum, a sick rutabaga.
>He is able to steal and drive awkwardly. He has boogied one too many time 
>before. Now he waddles all the time.
