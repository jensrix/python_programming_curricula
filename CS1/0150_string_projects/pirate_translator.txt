'''

For 18 points, write a program that translates anything the user types
into pirate speak (or another language of your choosing, but I will
explain the rest of the directions using the pirate example).

You will make use of the replace function for this project. Try out
the following code as an example:'''
text = "Where are the gold coins?"
text = text.replace("are", "arrgh")
print(text)

'''You must ask the user for a sentence of input, then perform at least 
three different replacements. You may also add something onto the end.

Consider also making common replacements such as
you -> ye
friend -> matey
etcetera

Interaction with your program might look like the following:
>Type something in
Hey, buddy, nice car. Have you met the new art teacher? 
>Or as a pirate says: "Hey, matey, nice frigate. Have you met the new arrrght teacher?
