I watched this. It's great. Could re-listen while making dinner:

Notes:
-Start students off in the shell for more immediate feedback and ease of introduction
-Diversify variable names. Students are hungry for patterns, don't teach them the wrong ones.
-early strings project: given two essays as lists of strings, write a program that grades essays. Students can use if statements and the in keyword.
-celebrate errors: the computer is trying to communicate with you!
-emphasize that students must act. Don't sit there and think. Act! Try things.

Day 1 of school: who am I, what I did over the summer. Stuff like: dog, writing, marie's art, CSTA conference.
What are my goals as a teacher.

Same questions to students. Who are you? How was your summer? What are your goals?

Maybe they all share with neighbor then the neighbor introduces them to someone else or teacher calls on folks in the class to share with everyone.

Discuss the class.

Watch 3 min of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDA3_5982h8

Then students form groups of 2 or 3 and try to write better instructions on some scrap paper.

(Perhaps suggest sub instructions for what it means to get something out of a jar, or to spread using a knife, essentially a function.)

================================================

This class has students from all upper school grades. People you may not know. One major goal for today is to meet your classmates.

Introduce yourself.
Ask everyone to think about what they would like to get out of the class or what you expect or what you are curious or confused about.
Group everyone in neighbors or trios (possibly in front or behind, not neighbors to the side). Introduce yourself and share your thoughts.
Then ask indviduals in each group to introduce someone else in their own group and tell me something about what the other person thinks or hopes about the class.
Hand out syllabus and discuss. Try to keep it brief.
Hand out computers and pair people up. Record numbers of people and computer matches.
Put up on projector your computer screen and demo "hello world" in pyscripter.

================================================
Day 2

Share google links with everyone.

Put up on projector the shared files and discuss how they will work.

Demo how to create a label in Gmail.

Today is a day for logging in to typing tutor, getting gmail filters and labels set up, getting pyscripter and python set up and trouble shooting.

Before you set them loose, they MUST seek help from their neighbors before raising hand to ask the teacher.
