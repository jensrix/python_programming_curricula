'''For 35 points, answer the following questions.

Create a python program named reader.py in the same folder as the 
data.txt file. Copy the following code into the program and run it. 
1) Compare what is printed to what you see by opening the text file in 
notepad.
'''

#Open for reading. The 'r' stands for reading. We could 
# use 'w' for writing, but let's save that for later.
file_handle = open('data.txt', 'r')
#Read the first line
line = file_handle.readline()
print(line)


'''2) What is different if we call readline() again like this?'''
#Open for reading. The 'r' stands for reading.
file_handle = open('data.txt', 'r')
line = file_handle.readline()
line = file_handle.readline()
print(line)


'''So readline() automatically goes to the next line each time you 
call it.
3) What happens if you keep reading beyond the end of the file?
Meaning, what happens if you call readline more times than there are 
lines in the file?'''



'''An empty string variable is treated like False. Run the following program to see what I mean.
4) If empty string variables were treated as True, what would have 
printed?'''
line = ""
if line:
    print("The line says: "+line)
else:
    print("The line is empty.")
'''This is useful to read through a whole file with a loop and stop at the end. For example:
'''
#Open for reading. The 'r' stands for reading.
file_handle = open('data.txt', 'r')
#Fill the line variable with anything except an empty string so it 
#will be treated like True.
line = 'temporary'
#Read and print every line.
while line:
    line = file_handle.readline()
    print(line)

'''Why are there blank lines when we print, but no blank lines in 
our data.txt file? It's because there is an invisible symbol at the 
end of each line that tells Python to make a new line.
Let's strip that invisible symbol off.

Inside the while loop, after line = file_handle.readline() but before print(line) insert the code line = line.strip()

Re-run the program.
'''


'''Suppose I want a list of 1,2,3 or A,B,C. How can I split those up?
'''
#Open for reading. The 'r' stands for reading.
file_handle = open('data.txt', 'r')
file_handle.readline() #Skip the first line
file_handle.readline() #Skip the second line
#Read the third line
line = file_handle.readline()
line = line.strip()
list = line.split(',')
print(list)
print(list[0])
print(list[1])
print(list[2])

'''Something weird happens if you don't use strip. Comment that line 
out in the previous program, re-run it.
5) What happens differently?

6) Modify the above program to read in the line A,B,C, then print the 
line as a list and then just prints the letter C from the list.
