For 70 points, write a program to print out all the proper names of 
stars in the hygdata_v3.csv file.

In this project you will learn to read in a CSV (comma-separated values) file using Python and extract data from the file.

STEP 1: Begin by going to this website then download the HYG 3.0 database and save the database file to your python folder:	www.astronexus.com/hyg
			Or	https://github.com/astronexus/HYG-Database

STEP 2: Create a python file named galaxy_reader.py

STEP 3: Use what you learned in the reader_investigation to open the 
file and print every line.

STEP 4: Use the split command on the lines you are reading in from the 
csv file and only print the 7th string in the list (Reminder: use 
index 6 to print the 7th piece of data). This should print the proper 
name of various stars.

STEP 5: You will notice lots of blanks. Many stars do not have proper 
names. Use an if statement to print only if a star does have a proper 
name. If a star does not have a proper name, its name will be equal to 
the empty string "".
