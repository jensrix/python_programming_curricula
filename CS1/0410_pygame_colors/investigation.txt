For 35 points, answer the following questions.

Read through the code in colorPlay.py and colors.py.
Pay particular attention to 
from colors import *
Then answer the following questions.


1. What error do you get when you comment out 
from colors import *
in colorPlay.py?


Uncomment
from colors import *
so that the program is back to the way it was originally.

2. What is different about the program when you comment out i=i+1?

3. Why is i=i+1 important?


I downloaded pygame_drawing_examples.py from the pygame website. You will notice that it has a different organizational style for its game loop.
Comment out
BLACK = (  0,   0,   0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BLUE =  (  0,   0, 255)
GREEN = (  0, 255,   0)
RED =   (255,   0,   0)
from pygame_drawing_examples.py then use
from colors import *
and some other small changes to modify pygame_drawing_examples.py to 
work again using the colors in colors.py.

4. What did you need to change?


5. Create at least one new color in colors.py, name it, and write the 
line of code that creates it here.
