For 35 points, write a program that prints the x intercepts of a 
quadratic equation. In other words, write a program that calculates
the quadratic formula.

You will need to ask the user for the coefficiencts a, b, and c.

You will need to use
import math
and to use
math.sqrt()

math.sqrt() calculates the square root of whatever number you give it.
For example:
math.sqrt(4) #This prints 2
math.sqrt(36) #This prints 6

You may need to use parentheses to enforce order of operations. 
Python will perform order of operations the same as your calculator.

Check your program by using coefficients you know how to factor.
For example y=x^2+3x+2 is the same as y=(x+1)(x+2)

Interaction with your program might look like the following:
>What is the leading coefficient a?
1
>What is the second coefficient b?
3
>What is the constant term c?
2
>The x intercepts are -1 and -2
