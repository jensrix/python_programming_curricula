For 18 points, write a program that asks the user for a name and 
then another name. Then print the names in the order the user typed
them in, then swap the variable values and print them again.

Some code has been provided below. Fill in the blanks.

Interaction with your program might look like the following:

>Give me a name:
Tom
>Give me another name:
Jerry
Tom
Jerry
Jerry
Tom

#Get the two names as input
#WRITE YOUR CODE HERE

print(name1) #If this prints Tom 
print(name2) #...and this prints Jerry

#Swap the values in name1 and name2
#WRITE YOUR CODE HERE

print(name1) #Then this should now print Jerry
print(name2) #...and this should print Tom
