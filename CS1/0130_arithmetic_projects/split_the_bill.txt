For 35 points, write a program that figures out a restuarant bill by 
1 asking how many people dined together,
2 asking what percent to tip,
3 asking for the amount of the bill,
4 and finally printing the amount that each person should pay assuming
everyone wants to split the bill evenly.

Interaction with your program might look like the following:
>How many people?
4
>What percent tip?
0.2
>What was the bill?
114.50
>Your total bill is $137.4.
>Each person should pay $35.35.
