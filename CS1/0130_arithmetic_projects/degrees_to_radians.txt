'''

For 18 points, write a program that uses input to ask the 
user for an angle in degrees and then converts that angle 
to an angle in radians by multiplying by pi divided by 180.

Make sure to make any type conversions that you need, such as 
converting the string given by input to an integer.

Print out the resulting radian measure.

Interaction with your program might look like the following:

> Give me a measure in degrees
90
> 90 degrees is 1.57 radians
