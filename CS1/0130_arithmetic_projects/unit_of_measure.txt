For 18 points, write a program that asks the user for their name 
and height in inches (make sure to convert to the correct type). 
Then print out each of the following distances in units of their name.

The golden gate bridge is ______ long.
The Earth is ______ in diameter.
The distance from the Earth to the moon is ______.

You will have to google the above distances and calculate the conversion.

BONUS: Express the width of a single-celled organism in 
milli-person's-name. (The milli means 1/1000.)

Interaction with your program might look like the following (I made up 
all these numbers):

> What is your name
Paul
> How tall are you in inches?
65

>The golden gate bridge is 266 Pauls long.
>The Earth is 120,944 Pauls in diameter.
>The distance from the Earth to the moon is 560,098 kiloPauls.
>A paramecium is 0.06 milliPauls wide.
