For 18 points, write a conversion program that converts between units 
of measure. You may choose the units. Feel free to use goofy units 
like knots and furlongs and moles.

For instance, you might ask how many mole-kilometers wide is the galaxy?
In other words, how many 6.02*10^23 * 1000 meters wide?

You will have to google any units or distances you don't know.
