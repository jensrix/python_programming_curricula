1) What problem is the program in the video inspired by?

2) The variable named user starts out as a string. How do I need to change user to use it as an index?

3) What is encapsulation?

4) Why do I have to write an if statement with code that swaps minimum and maximum?

5) Define a class named Cat. Write a constructor (an init function) for the class that takes one True or False variable called has_stripes as input, and stores the value of has_stripes in an attribute (a self variable).

6) Write a short program that creates a list of 10 random numbers using a loop and append. Then the program should let the user choose 5 numbers out of the list and add those numbers together. At the end of the program, print the sum as the user's score.

This is related to, but different from the program written in the video.

7) Write a short program that fills a list with 10 random numbers and then finds and prints the smallest value in the list.
