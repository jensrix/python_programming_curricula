For 280 points, write a hangman-playing program. You must complete
the hangman design assignment before starting this.

#The following example will show you how to test if a letter is in a list or in a string.
secret_word = 'xylophone'
if 'a' in secret_word:
    print('a is in the word')
else:
    print('a is NOT in the word')
#Here's another example using a variable.
letter = 'x'
if letter in secret_word:
    print(letter+' is in the word')
else:
    print(letter+' is NOT in the word')

Your hangman game should let the user guess a letter each round and the 
game should display blanks for the word with certain letters filled in 
as well as some kind of ascii representation of how many mistakes the 
user has made.
