I (Alex) did a reverse image search of one of the images you gave us through google images and found out it's Blob from Clayfighter: Tournament Edition(http://clayfighter.wikia.com/wiki/Blob and footage of him in game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmvEIO2Blg). From there I found a sprite list of the all of extracted .pngs of him from the game.

Thanks to Alex Tenorio for finding the source for me.
