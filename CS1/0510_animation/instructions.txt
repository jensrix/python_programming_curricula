For 140 points, make an animation of the blob (see images folder) that
walks half way across the screen and then turns around and walks back.

You will want to pre-load lists of images for this program. You will 
need a variable to keep track of the index of the variable you are
currently drawing on the screen.

Challenge (40 extra points): Make the blob jump. You will need to 
modify the blob's y value as well as x for this.
