#For 17 points, answer the following questions.


#1. The following code never prints C. Explain why not.
x = int(input("Give me a number"))
y = int(input("Give me a number"))
if x > 0:
	print("A")
elif y > 0:
	print("B")
elif x > 0 and y < 0:
	print("C")


#2. Change the code in the previous question so that it 
#prints C sometimes, but can still print A and B.


#3. What is wrong with the following code?
x = int(input("give me a number"))
if x=0:
	x = x+10


#4. What is wrong with the following code?
x = int(input("give me a number"))
if x>0
	x = x+10


'''5. Identify at least three errors in the following code. 
(The indentation is correct.)'''
if num_neighbors >= 3 or num_neighbors = 4
	num_neighbors = num_neighbors + 1
else
	num_neighbors = num_neighbors - 1


'''Consider the following code. Assume that does_big_work, makes_breakthrough,
and nobel_prize_candidate are all boolean variables that were created
earlier in the program:

if does_big_work:
	if makes_breakthrough:
		nobel_prize_candidate = True
	else:
		nobel_prize_candidate = False
elif !does_big_work:
	nobel_prize_candidate = False

6. Write a simpler version of the code above that does the exact same thing.
7. Write a single assignment statement that does the same thing as the code above.

Two examples follow that may help you with questions 6 and 7:

#We want the variable named precipitation to increase if it rains or snows. We could write our program like this:

rains = True
snows = False
if rains:
	precipitation = precipitation+1
else if snows:
	precipitation = precipitation+1

#But a shorter and easier-to-read way to write the program is this:

if rains or snows:
	precipitation = precipitation+1


#We want a program that decreases the variable hitpoints if the player gets hit by an enemy and does not have the invincibility powerup
if self.hitByEnemy():
	if not self.isInvincible():
		hitpoints = hitpoints-1

#A better way to write this code follows:
if self.hitByEnemy()and not self.isInvincible():
	hitpoints = hitpoints-1
'''


'''8. Use the variables allen_parlour_size and 
nabbey_parlour_size to write a condition that expresses 
the same thing as this quote:

Mr. Allen's dining-parlour was not more than half as large (compared 
to the dining-parlour at Northanger Abbey).
-Northanger Abbey by Jane Austen'''
