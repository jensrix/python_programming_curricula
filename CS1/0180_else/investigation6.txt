'''1. Jim currently runs a car rental dealership and wishes to write a 
program that allows the user to enter in the temperature of the location 
they plan to visit and then recommend a car based on the data.  Below is 
a summary of the program structure Jim is looking for.
	Temp greater than 80 a Convertible should be selected
	Temp  greater than 60 and less than 80 an SUV should be selected
	Temp less than 60 a truck should be selected.
Jim has no trouble writing the code if the temperate is greater than 80 but 
gets stuck when he tries to write code for when Temp is greater than 60 and 
less than 80. Help Jim by writing the condition he is struggling with.

'''2. Write a program that asks the user for a short word. If the 
word is more than 4 letters, print "I wanted a short word!". 
Otherwise do nothing.'''


'''3. Given that I want to know if two numbers are greater than 10,

#A. if speed >= 75:
#B. elif speed > 70:
#C. else speed<=70:
#D. print("Issue speeding ticket")


#6. What does the following program print? Guess before running it.
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]

'''8. Stacy is automating her kitchen. She needs a program that 
can prepare a timely breakfast based on how much time she has

    If time is greater than 5 and less than 15, make toast.
    Otherwise make eggs.
Write Stacy's program. Print the chosen food.'''

whatever==False there is an error. Test to verify then
explain why this happens.'''
if whatever:
    x = 0
else:

'''10. If whatever==True there is no problem, but if 
whatever==False there is an error. Test to verify then
explain why this happens.'''

coin 2. Fix the code so that it works properly.'''

'''12. The following program got scrambled. Rearrange the 
lines of code so that they make sense. Include proper 
indentation.'''
