For 20 points, watched the video "Else green red" found here:
https://youtu.be/ZL5jvG4em_Y
and answer the following questions.


1. How does the narrator change the first program so it prints "Green is also my fav" ONLY when the user types "Green"?

2. What prints the first time the narrator types in Christmas?

3. The else code runs under what condition? In other words, what has to be True (or False) for else to run?

4. How many elif's can you chain together?

5. How does a programmer indicate that certain code goes "inside" an if (or an elif or an else)?
