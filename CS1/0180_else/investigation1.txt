Else statements are always paired with if statements.
Else statements are never found without an if.
Else means the same as otherwise.

if something is True
	then do this
otherwise the thing is False
	do this

if it's cold outside:
    put on a coat
else:
    put on sandles

1. Make up an example of another if-else and write it in pseudo-code
(pseudo-code is fake code that is closer to English, like above).


Elif statements let you check if some other condition is met before running
some other code. Elif statements are also always paired with if statements.
Elif is short for Else-If

if something is True
	do this
elif the first things is False and a second thing is True
	then do this
else
	do this third thing


if it's snowing:
	put on a coat
elif it's raining:
	get an umbrella
else:
	enjoy the great outdoors

2. Make up an example of another if-else and write it in pseudo-code.


If statements can be put inside other if statements. It can help clean up your code.

if raining:
	if weekday:
		get umbrella
	else:
		stay inside

3. Write your own nested if statement for something other than the given example.
