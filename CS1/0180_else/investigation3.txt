For 17 points, answer the following questions.


#1. Use input, if, and elif to write a program that checks 
#if I play rock and you play scissors, then prints "I win",
#but if I play rock and you play paper, prints "you win".


#2. Write an if statement that checks if an integer variable named 
#age is less than zero and if so prints the word error.


#3. Write an if statement that checks if an integer variable named x 
#is greater than or equal to zero and if so adds 6 to x.


'''Reminder: You can check how many letters are in a string using the
length function, len().
4. Does the following print "it is longer" or not?'''
if len("short") > len("long"):
    print("it is longer")


'''Compare the following programs.
5. Do they print different things when given the same input?
6. Which program do you think is better? Why?'''

#PROGRAM 1:
a = 5.7
b = 26
c = 140
if c/a > b:
    print("Something")
else:
    print("other")

#PROGRAM 2:
a = 5.7
b = 26
c = 140
result = c/a > b
if result:
    print("Something")
else:
    print("other")


'''Compare the following programs.
7. Do they print different things when given the same input?
8. Which program do you think is better? Why?'''

#PROGRAM 1:
user_in = input("What is your name?")
if len(user_in) > 10:
    print("Do you have a nickname?")

#PROGRAM 2:
user_in = input("What is your name?")
is_long = len(user_in) > 10
if is_long:
