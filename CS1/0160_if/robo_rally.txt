UnPlugged Activity

For 50 points each, find a partner and get out one of the RoboRally board
games. Examine the boards and skim through the instructions (though your
instructions are different).

Your goal is to write instructions, on paper, to guide a robot to collect
three flags.

For example, your instructions might look like:

	if forward gets me closer to the next flag:
		move forward
	else:
		turn right

There are 3 catches:
1. Your robot must avoid the pits, cannot cross walls, and after each move
your robot will be conveyed if it lands on a conveyor.
2. The other person will obey your robot instructions literally. You
don't steer your own robot.
3. You and your partner must write robot instructions separately.

You may revise your robot instructions.

Once you are done you must turn in
1. The instructions you wrote and the name of your partner.
2. Answers to the following questions:
-What went right on the first try?
-What went wrong on the first try?
-How did you fix what went wrong?
