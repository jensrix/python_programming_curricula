'''1. The last day of final exams is May 24th. Write a program that checks 
if day is greater than 24 and if so prints out "summer break".'''

'''2. Write a program with two variables named teacher_score and student_score.
Start the variables off with any value you like. Write the code that will print 
"Teacher victory" if the teacher has a higher score and will print 
"Student victory" if the student score is higher.'''

'''3. Write a program that asks the user for two different numbers, x and y.
If x equals zero, print out "divide by zero error". Otherwise print out
the result of y divided by x.'''

'''4. Write a program that gets input from the user. Then if the user typed "hi"
the program responds with "hello". If the user typed "bye", respond with "goodbye".
If the user types anything else, respond with "No thanks, I'm full".

'''5. Write an if statement that checks if an integer variable named x is 
greater than zero and if so adds 10 to x.'''

'''6. Write code that checks if an integer variable named count is less than 
or equal to zero. If so, the code sets count equal to 100. If count is 
greater than zero, the code decreases count by 1.'''
