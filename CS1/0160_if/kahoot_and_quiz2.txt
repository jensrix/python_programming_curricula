This program always prints swamp. Why?
if "frogs":
    print("swamp")
else:
    print("meadow")

an error causes it to default to the first option
"frogs" is treated like a True statement
Python prefers swamps to meadows
"frogs" are True, but "deer" are False


The following code ALWAYS prints gloomy. Why?
sky = "sunny"
if sky=="cloudy" or "overcast":
    print("gloomy")
else:

should have used and instead of or
should have used sky=="cloudy" or sky=="overcast"
