I assume you have already watched the "List Pop Culture" found here:

and answered the questions found here:

If so, then for 40 points, if you have your own idea of some "Lists in Pop Culture", send your instructor a link to the pop culture reference or describe it to them, along with some code using lists that represents the reference. Email this to your instructor with the subject line: "CS1: List References".
