#For 35 points, answer the following questions.


'''1. Write a function that takes a single number named x and returns 
a list of all the numbers from x to 0 in descending order. For example, 
if 5 is passed to the function, then the function should return a list 
that equals [5,4,3,2,1,0].'''


'''2. The following program contains a function that searches for the
smallest value in a list and returns the index of that value. The
program also includes an example call to the function to test it out.
Unscramble the code to make it work. Include proper indentation.'''
index = 0
