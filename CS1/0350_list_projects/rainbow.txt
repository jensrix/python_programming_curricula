For 70 points, write a program that uses lists, loops, and turtles to 
draw a rainbow.

Consider using the following code fragment (the print is there only 
to help you see what is going on):

#List of colors in order.
#This will let us greatly shorten the code!
roygbiv = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet']
for color in roygbiv:
    print(color)

Remember that you can put loops INSIDE of other loops.

If your program is shorter than 40 lines (NOT including comments and blank lines), you get 20 bonus points.
