For 35 points, write a "Magic 8-Ball" program.
The magic 8 ball is a toy that responds to yes or no questions
with one of 8 responses randomly.

For example:
Will it rain today?
>You may rely on it

Will my team win the game?
>Concentrate and ask again

You must put as many responses as you want in a list and randomly 
choose which one to use to answer the user's questions.

Use random.randint to pick a random whole number, then use that whole 
number to index into the list.
