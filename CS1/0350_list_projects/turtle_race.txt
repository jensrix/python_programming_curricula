For 140 points, write a turtle racing program.

Line up at least 5 turtles on a starting line. Put all the turtles in
a list. Make all the turtles different colors.

Draw a finish line as well. Then loop repeatedly and move a random 
turtle forward. Each time the loop repeats, move a new turtle forward.
Once a turtle reaches the finish line, end the race.
