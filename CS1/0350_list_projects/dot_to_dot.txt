For 200 points, write a program that creates a dot-to-dot image using turtles.

You must
-Design the dot-to-dot on paper beforehand (I recommend using graph paper). This will save you time in the long run by letting you figure out where all the coordinates will be located.
-Use lists to store the coordinates.
-Include a boolean (True/False) variable such that the turtle connects the dots when it is True, and does not connect them when it is false. Use this for testing that your dot-to-dot draws what you want.
-Use the turtle write command to number the dots.
