For 70 points, write a program that prints out a different wacky 
story each time you run the program by choosing different nouns, verbs, 
or adjectives from lists.

For example, if you start with the template:
The ADJECTIVE1 NOUN1 went to LOCATION1 to VERB1 the NOUN2, but the NOUN1 
had to return to LOCATION2 because NOUN1 VERB2 a NOUN3.

Then one run of your program might print:
The wooly farmer went to the store to peck the clouds, but the farmer 
had to return to the cave because farmer ate a pigeons.

But the next run of your program could print something different in 
every underlined location.

Think about the pieces involved in this program.
 - You will need lists of adjectives, locations, verbs, and nouns.
 - You will need to use random to generate random numbers.
 - You will need a variable to store any words you would like to repeat 
 such as NOUN1 in the MadLib above.

For full credit you need to repeat one of your variables, perhaps the 
protagonist's name will be repeated, for example.
