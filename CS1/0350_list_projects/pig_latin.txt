For 70 points, write a program that repeats back user sentences in
pig latin. Your program should make use of the split function to divide
strings into separate words. You should also leave words that begin
with vowels alone.

The following examples will help you get started.

#You can check to see if the first letter of a string is a vowel like this:
word = 'aardvark
vowels = ['a','e','i','o','u']
if word[0] in vowels:
    print('This word begins with a vowel.')

#You can split up the first letter and the remainder of a word, like this:
word = 'tackle'
first_letter = word[0]
remainder = word[1:]
print(first_letter)
print(remainder)

#You can split up the second letter and the remainder of a word, like this:
word = 'throw'
first_letter = word[0]
second_letter = word[1]
remainder = word[2:]
print(second_letter)
print(remainder)
