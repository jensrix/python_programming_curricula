For 15 points, answer the following questions.



'''1. Programs that interact with the user are more interesting than those
that don't. Describe in one sentence what the following code does.'''
input("What's your name?")

'''2. This is not useful unless we can get the response the user writes.
Run this program and enter different responses, then press enter.
What happens?'''
response = input("What is your name?")
print("Hello, "+response)

'''3. Addition of numbers works like in math class. Addition of 
strings (aka text) is different. What happens when you add strings?'''
print(7+3)
print("Hello, "+" Bartholomew")

#4. Why doesn't this code print 10?
print("7"+"3")

'''5. Python knows how to add numbers and it knows how to add strings,
but what happens when you try to add strings to numbers? Write some code
to try it out.'''

'''6. Anything you type in to input is saved as a string (in other words, text).
What happens when you try the following?'''
x = input("What's your favorite number?")
y = x+1
print("I prefer "+y)

'''7. Here are three different fixes for the previous program.
Which do you prefer and why?'''

#OPTION A:
x = int(input("What's your favorite number?"))
y = str(x+1)
print("I prefer "+y)

#OPTION B:
x = input("What's your favorite number?")
y = int(x)+1
print("I prefer "+str(y))

#OPTION C:
x = input("What's your favorite number?")
x = int(x)
y = x+1
y = str(y)
print("I prefer "+y)


#8. Why doesn't this fix the problem?
x = int(input("What's your favorite number?"))
y = x+1
print("I prefer "+y)

#9. This program is broken in multiple ways. Fix it.
name = input("What is your name?")
age = input("What is your age?")
print("name is age years old")

'''10. I want to ask the user for their favorite number and then add 3
to it. The following program does not do what I want. Fix it.'''
x = input("What is your favorite number?")
x = int(x)
x + 3
print(x)

#11. Fix this program:
input = ("is it raining?")
print(rain_result)

#12. Fix this program:
weather = input("is it sunny?")
print(input)
