For 35 points, write a function that adds two numbers together and
returns their sum, but you can only use +1. In other words, if I want to
add a and b, I can't just return a+b. Instead I have to use a loop
and +1.

For 35 points, write a muliplication function that only uses addition.

For 35 points, write a subtraction function that only uses -1. In 
other words, if I want to subtract a and b, I can't just return a-b. 
Instead I have to use a loop and -1.

For 35 points, write a function that divides two numbers without using 
the division symbol. Your function only needs to work on numbers that
evenly divide.
