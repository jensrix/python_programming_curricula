Functions are a convenient way to divide your code into 
useful blocks, allowing us to order our code, make it more
readable, reuse it and save some time.

Functions in python are defined using the keyword "def",
followed by the function's name, then parentheses (possibly
with arguments inside), then a colon, then on the next line
indented code that will be run when the function is called.
Arguments must have commas between them.

What is missing from each of the following function definitions?
Your options are: def, the function name, parentheses, colon, or comma

1)	 def  myFunction()

2)	 otherFunction():

3)	 def  (a, b):

4)	 def  functionName a, b:

5)	 def  goodFunction(a b):

Functions may also receive arguments (variables passed from 
the caller to the function). Arguments are variables and 
they must be separated by a comma. For example, the following 
function has 2 arguments: username and greeting.

def  myFunction(username, greeting):
         print("Hello, "+username+" , I wish you "+greeting)

How would you fix the arguments in each of the following functions?

6)
def calculate(x  y):
	return x+y

7)
def combineStrings(a):
	print(a+"  "+b)

Functions may return a value to the caller, using the keyword return. For example:

def sumTwoNumbers(a, b):
	return a + b

The keyword return ends a function.

def sumTwoNumbers(a, b):
	return a + b
	print("This will never ever print.")

When a function gets called, the function call gets replaced by the value it returns. For example, when the following line of code gets run

x = sumTwoNumbers(4, 6)
the function call, sumTwoNumbers(4,6), gets replaced by the return value
x = 10
then 10 becomes the value of the variable x.

Print is different from return. Print merely puts text on the command window. This next function does not return anything.

def combineStrings(a):
	print(a+"  "+b)

The following programs all use the sumTwoNumbers function defined above. What does each program print?

8)
x = 5
y = 2
print(sumTwoNumbers(x,y))


9)
x = 5
y = 2
x = sumTwoNumbers(x,y)
print(x)


10)
x = 5
y = 2
x = sumTwoNumbers(x, 4)
print(x)


11)
x = 5
y = 2
sumTwoNumbers(x, 4)
print(x)


12)
x = 5
y = 2
print(x)
x = sumTwoNumbers(x, 4)


13)	Write a function that returns the subtracted value of its 
arguments (in other words, if you pass the values 7 and 5, the 
function will subtract 7-5 and return 2) then write code that 
calls this function and prints the result. Use whatever values 
you like.
