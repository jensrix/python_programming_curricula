'''For 17 points, answer the following questions.


'''Suppose I have a function named liar that takes a string as 
input. If the string is a True statement then the function returns 
False. If the statement is False then the function returns True. 
For example, the following program prints "True":'''
response = liar("The moon is made of cheese.")
print(response)
#1. What does this program print? (There is a correct answer!)
response = liar("Ashaya is a good dog.")
print(response)


'''2. If the liar function always responds to statements with a 
lie, which of the following functions always returns the truth?
A.
def truth(statement):
    return liar(statement) or not liar(statement)
B.
def truth(statement):
    return not liar(statement)
C.
def truth(statement):
    return True
'''


'''3. Does the following function ever return True?
4. Does it ever return False?'''
def truth(statement):
    return liar(statement) or not liar(statement)


#5. What does the following program print?
if liar('Pigs fly') and liar('Earth is flat') and liar('Moon is cheese'):
    print('What a strange universe!')
else:
    print('Obviously not.')


'''6. Use the liar function to complete the following "two 
truths and one lie" program to determine which statement is the 
lie. (Note: The game "two truths and one lie" is simple. One 
person makes 3 statements about themself, one of which is a lie.
Everyone else then guesses which statement is the lie.)'''
statement1 = input('What is your first statement?')
statement2 = input('What is your second statement?')
statement3 = input('What is your third statement?')
