'''For 35 points, write a program that has a function named
proportionSolver. This function should take 3 arguments a, b,
and c. The function should then return the value of x in
the equation:

a/b = c/x

In other words, you're writing a function to solver
a/b = c/x given any a, b, and c.

For instance:
5/9 = 3/x
means that x = 27/5
