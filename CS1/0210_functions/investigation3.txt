'''1. Functions that return a value are replaced by that value 
when you call them. Is the following function ever different
from the number 5?'''
def five():
    return 5
print(five())
print(5)
if 5 == five():
    print('They are the same')
x = 2+five()
print(x)


'''2. Write one line of code that calls the nonsense function 
doStuff with the argument 8.'''
def doStuff(argument):
	if argument>1:
		print(argument)


#3. Does the x value of 4 or 7 get passed to the addTwo function?
x = 7
def addTwo(x):
	return x+2
x = 4
x = addTwo(x)
print(x)


#4. What does this code print?
#5. Why doesn't it print 6?
def addTwo(x):
	return x+2
x = 4
addTwo(x)
print(x)


'''6. What happens when you call a function that wants an 
argument with no argument?'''
def printWithGreeting(text):
	print("Hello, "+text)
printWithGreeting()


#7. Does this fix it? Why or why not?
text = Neal
def printWithGreeting(text):
	print("Hello, "+text)
printWithGreeting()


#8. How about this?
def printWithGreeting(text):
	print("Hello, "+text)
text = "Neal"
printWithGreeting(text)


#9. Do the following programs print the same thing?
#Program A
def printWithGreeting(text):
	print("Hello, "+text)
x = "Neal"
printWithGreeting(x)
#Program B
def printWithGreeting(text):
	print("Hello, "+text)
printWithGreeting("Neal")

that takes no arguments.'''


'''11. Write the definition for a function named cosine that 
takes one argument named angle.'''
