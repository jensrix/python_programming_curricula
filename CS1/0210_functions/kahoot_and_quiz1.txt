A function is all of the following except what
a self-contained action
a miniature program with input and output
a part of memory
called using its name and parentheses


Which calls the following function?
def sayHello():
	print("Hello!")
A sayHello()
B sayHello
C sayHello():
D def sayHello():


True or False
def is short for definitely


Fill in the blank with a call to the function so this program will print "Hello, Holt."
def helloHolt():
	return "Hello, Holt"
print(______________________)
A helloHolt()
B "helloHolt()"
C "helloHolt"
D helloHolt():


Fill in the blank with a call to the function so this program prints "Hello, Mr. Sinfield"
def helloTo(person):
	return "Hello, "+person
print(____________________)
A helloTo("Mr. Sinfield")
B "Hello, Mr. Sinfield"
C helloTo(Mr. Sinfield)
D "helloTo(Mr. Sinfield)"


A function is called with
A its name followed by parentheses
B a variable and an equals sign
C def and a colon
D a return statement


Fill in the blank with a call to the function so this program prints "Hello, Mr. Sinfield"
def helloTo(person):
	print("Hello, "+person)
_____________
A helloTo("Mr. Sinfield")
B print(helloTo("Mr. Sinfield"))
C print("helloTo(Mr. Sinfield)")
D print(helloTo(Mr. Sinfield))


True or False
return ends a function and gives back a value


What does this code print?
def multiply(a,b):
	return a*b
multiply(7,4)
A 28
B nothing
C 11
D return


True or False
def is short for define


What does this code print?
def multiply(a,b):
	return a*b
print(multiply(7,4))
A 28
B nothing
C 11
D return


Function names should be action verbs or verb phrases like all of the following except
print
goto
draw
tree


Turtle code violates the rule of verb-named functions with all the following examples except:
xcor
color
right
goto


A better "action verb" name for the turtle xcor function would be
xvalue
getxcor


A better "action verb" name for the turtle color function would be
turtleColor
setColor


A better "action verb" name for the turtle right function would be
turnRight
otherLeft


Turtle code violates the rule of verb-named functions because programmers are
Correct: lazy
Correct: efficient
Incorrect: don't know parts of speech
Incorrect: can't spell


Functions are called using their name followed by parentheses. All of the following are examples of this except
print("Hello")
pen.goto(40, 200)
exit
x = input("Give a number")
