'''For 35 points, complete the following assignment.

Attached is a Python file with 4 functions in it.

Your task is to write code that calls each function and prints 
the return value. Use the unformation you gain to figure out 
what each function does and give each function a better name.

This might mean calling the function with lots of different 
arguments until you figure out what it does. Some functions will 
be harder to figure out than others. Feel free to go out of order.

Some functions are useful. Others are nonsense. See if you can 
figure out which is which.

To complete this assignment you need to turn in:
1. The code you used to call the functions and print their results.
2. A better name for each function
3. A one-sentence description of what each function does.
