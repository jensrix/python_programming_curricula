For 35 points, read the information about while loops below then 
answer the following questions.

While loops have two parts: a condition and a body, just like if statements.

while condition:
	body

Similar to
if condition:
	body

The body is indented. The code in the body is executed repeatedly
as long as the condition is true.

Here is a fully functional program using while loops:'''

cold = True
while cold:
	print("wear coat")

'''This could be expressed in english as
"as long as it is cold, wear a coat".

The only problem is that the value of the cold variable is never 
changed. The above program prints "wear coat" forever.

(You can kill the program by clicking the red square button.)


Here is a program that teaches kids how to count to 10 with the help 
of the Count.'''

#Declare how high we will count
n = 5
#Declare who is counting
name = "The Count"
#Loop up to n, counting and laughing as the Count does along the way.
i = 1
while i < n+1:
    print(str(i)+" ah! ah! ahhh!")
    i = i + 1
print("and that is how "+name+" counts to "+str(n))


'''The previous program is better written using a for loop.
1. Rewrite it using a for loop instead of a while loop.'''


'''For loops are good for counting and for repeating a specific number
of times. While loops are better when we don't know how many 
repetitions are needed. For example:'''

x = ""
while x!='quit':
	x = input('Say quit to stop')

#2. What does the previous program do?


'''3. Write a while loop that repeats as long as a variable named x 
is less than 100. Inside the loop, increase x by one.'''


'''4. Use a while loop to print every fifth whole number from 5 to 45. 
Try to get your program down to only 4 lines of code.'''


'''5. Write a program that asks the user for the password and only 
ends when the user types opensesame.'''


'''While loops introduce a new problem that we've never dealt with
before, a program that runs forever and never ends.
6. which of the following loops never ends?'''
#OPTION A
x = 4
while x > 0:
	x = x-1
#OPTION B
x = 4
while x > 0:
	x = x+1
#OPTION C
x = 4
while 0 > 4:
	x = x+1


#7. What does this program print?
x = 0
while x<5:
	print(x)
	x = x+2


#8. What does this program print?
x = 10
while x<4:
	x = x+1
	print(x)


#9. What does this program print?
x = 5
while x != 1:
	print(x)
	if x%2==0: #if x is even
		x = x/2
	else: #else if x is odd
		x = 3*x+1


#10. How many times can you get the wrong answer before the program ends?
answer = input("What is the capital of France?")
lives = 6
while answer != "paris" and lives > 0:
    answer = input("What is the capital of France?")
    lives = lives - 2
