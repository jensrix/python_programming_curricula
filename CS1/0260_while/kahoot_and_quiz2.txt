Python: While and Review 2

(You should randomize the order of questions and answers)


What could the user type to end this program?
response = input("stay or leave")
while response == "stay":
	print('Here you are')
	response = input("stay or leave")
stay
leave
frog
horn


What could the user type to end this program?
response = input("stay or leave")
while response != "leave":
	print('Here you are')
	response = input("stay or leave")
stay
leave
frog
horn


What is a while loop?
Code that repeats while a condition is true
Code that repeats while counting up to a number
Code that repeats for each item in a list
A travesty



What does this code do?
number = 1
while number < 5:
    print(number)
    number = number + 1
#Prints 1 through 5
#Prints 1 through 4
#Adds up 1 through 5
#Adds up 1 through 4


How many times can you get the wrong answer before the program ends?
answer = input("What is the capital of France?")
lives = 9
while answer != "paris" and lives > 0:
    answer = input("What is the capital of France?")
    lives = lives - 2
ANSWER: 6


True or False: These two loops do the exact same thing.
#LOOP A
x=50
while x<100:
	print(x)
	x = x+1
#LOOP B
for i in range(50,100,5):
	print(i)


True or False: These two loops do the exact same thing.
#LOOP A
x=7
while x<13:
	print(x)
	x = x+2
#LOOP B
for i in range(7,14,2):
	print(i)


True or False: These two loops do the exact same thing.
#LOOP A
x=60
while x>0:
	print(x)
	x = x-1
#LOOP B
for i in range(60,0,-1):
	print(i)


I told my dog. "Go outside, while you're there do your business. Come back in." Dog never came back! I should have said
A Go outside, do your business, then come inside.
B Come inside. While outside, do your business.
C While inside, do your business. Go outside.
D Go outside. While outside, do your business.


True or False: You get an error when you write a loop that runs forever.
FALSE

True or False: A function is called with its name followed by parentheses.

Which of the following is NOT a function call?
exit()
int(response)
turtle.goto(8,40)
if (x<7):

Functions are defined by 
def then a name then parentheses then :
a name then parentheses
a name then parentheses then a colon
def then function

I want to choose one of three options. One option WILL be chosen. I should use...
if and else
if and elif and else
if and elif and elif
if and if and if

I want to choose one of three options or none of the options. I should use...
if and else
if and elif and else
if and elif and elif

I want to choose either of two options or both or none. I should use...

Fill in the blank so the program repeats until the user has set the desired temperature.
temperature = 50
comfort = input("Is temp ok?")
while comfort == "no":
	temperature = temperature+1
	comfort = ______________
input("Is temp ok?") answer
comfort+1
int(comfort)
"no"

What does this code print?
start = "b"
middle = ""
end = "s"
while len(start+middle+end)<4:
	middle = middle + "e"
print(start+middle+end)
bs
bess
bees
start middle end

What does this code print? If at the start i=2
while i!=1: #while i is not 1
	print(i)
	if i%2==0: #if i is even
		i = i/2
	else:
		i = 3*i + 1
Answer: 2
2  1
7  22  11  34  16  8  4  2
7  22  11  34  16  8  4  2  1

What does this code print? If at the start i=5
while i!=1: #while i is not 1
	print(i)
	if i%2==0: #if i is even
		i = i/2
	else: #else i is odd
		i = 3*i + 1
Answer: 5 16 8 4 2
