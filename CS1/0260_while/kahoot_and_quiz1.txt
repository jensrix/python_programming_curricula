Python: While and For 1


Use while instead of for...
when code might repeat more
when code is a chore
to return a number floor
if variables we need more

Use for instead of while...
when counting so infantile
with an electronic technophile
when life is futile
for sand so tactile

For loops are for...
repeating a specific number of times
returning a value
combining strings
defining a specific action

While loops are for...
repeating who knows how many times
choosing between actions
combining strings together
combining data and actions


True or False: While loops can run forever.


True or False: For loops can run forever.


True or False: These two programs do the exact same thing.
#PROGRAM A:
for i in range(2,12,4):
	print(i)
#PROGRAM B:
i=2
while i<12:
	print(i)
	i = i+4


True or False: These two programs do the exact same thing.
#PROGRAM A:
i=0
while i<15:
	i = i+1
	print(i)
#PROGRAM B:
for i in range(15):
	print(i)


True or False: These two programs do the exact same thing.
#PROGRAM A:
x=0
while x<200:
	print(x)
	x = x+1
#PROGRAM B:
for i in range(200):
	print(i)


True or False: An if statement is like a while loop that only happens zero or one times.


True or False: These two programs do the exact same thing.
#PROGRAM A:
x = input('number?')
if int(x)<10:
	print('less')
#PROGRAM B:
x = input('number?')
while int(x)<10:
	print('less')
	x = 10


True or False: These two programs do the exact same thing.
#PROGRAM A:
text = input('?')
if text=='frivolous':
	print('ok')
#PROGRAM B:
text = input('?')
while text=='frivolous':
	print('ok')
	text = ''


True or False: These two programs do the exact same thing.
#PROGRAM A:
text = input('?')
if text=='cat':
	print('no dog')
#PROGRAM B:
text = input('?')
while text=='cat':
	print('no dog')


True or False: This while loop repeats forever.
x = 50
while x > 0:
	if x<25:
		x = x*2
	else:
		x = x-1


True or False: This while loop repeats forever.
x = 5
while x < 0:
	if x<25:
		x = x*2
	else:
		x = x-1


True or False: This while loop repeats forever.
x = -1
while x < 0:
	if x<-4:
		x = x*2
	else:
		x = -1*x


How many times does this while loop repeat? (Same as asking how many times "Loop" is printed.)
x = 7
while x < 12:
	x = x*2 - 6
	print('Loop')


How many times does this while loop repeat? (Same as asking how many moves does the turtle make.)
import turtle
t = turtle.Turtle.()
while t.xcor() < 100:
	t.forward(5)


How many times will this while loop repeat?
response = input("stay or leave")
while response != "leave":
	print('Here you are')
A either zero or infinity
B impossible to determine
C zero
D at least once
