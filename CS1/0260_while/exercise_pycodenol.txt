For 10 points write the Pycodenol medical program:

Create three boolean variables named: anemia, high_cholesterol, 
heart_disease.

A patient should not take the new medication Pycodenol if they are 
anemic or if they have both high_cholesterol and heart_disease.

Write a program with an if and else statement that tells the user if 
they should take Pycodenol. You can set the values of the boolean 
variables however you like.
