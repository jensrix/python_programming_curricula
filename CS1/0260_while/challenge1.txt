For 35 points, complete the following challenge.
The world is running out of computer code. You need to write a program
that prints . then - repeatedly forever. For example, your output will
look like:
.
-
.
-
.
-
and so on.

However, your program can only use one loop: while(True)
Your program can only use 1 print statement.
You can use as many variables and if-statements as you need.

For example, you CANNOT use this as your answer because it has 2 
print statements:'''
while(True):
	print('.')
	print('-')

'''You also cannot use this:'''
while(True):
	print('.' , '-')

'''You can't use this either:'''
while(True):
	print('.\n-')
