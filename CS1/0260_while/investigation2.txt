For 18 points, answer the following questions.

1. If the user types "no" then enter, "y" then enter, "yes" then enter, 
what does the following program print? (Include the input text as 
printing.)'''
response = input('Continue?')
while response=="yes":
	response = input('Continue?')
print("I'm glad we're done.")


#2. What is the bug in the following code?
x=0
While x<100:
	x = x+1


#3. What is the bug in the following code?
x=0
while x<100
	x = int(input("Give me a number"))


#4. What is the bug in the following code?
x=0
while 0<100:
	x = int(input("Give me a number"))


'''5. Use a while-loop and if-statements to write a program that
prints "Are we there yet?" then takes input from the user.
If the user says "yes" then the program stops.
If the user says "no" then the program writes "Drive faster?" and 
repeats the question "are we there yet?"
If the user says anything else, the program writes "whatever!" and 
repeats the question "are we there yet?"
The program continues repeating its question forever until the user 
says "yes".'''
