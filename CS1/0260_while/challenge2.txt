For 50 points, complete the following challenge.
The world is running out of computer code. You need to write a program
that prints ... then - repeatedly forever. For example, your output 
will look like:
.
.
.
-
.
.
.
-
.
.
.
-
and so on.

However, your program can only use one loop: while(True)
Your program can only use 1 print statement.
You can use as many variables and if-statements as you need.

You CANNOT use this as your answer because it has too many print
statements:'''
while(True):
	print('.')
	print('.')
	print('.')
	print('-')

'''You also cannot use this:'''
while(True):
	print('.', '.', '.', '-')

'''You can't use this either:'''
while(True):
	print('.\n.\n.\n-')
