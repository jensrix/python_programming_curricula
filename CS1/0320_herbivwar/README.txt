students struggled with 
-understanding that functions end with the return statement
-that the function is for a single turn (they don't need to put their own loop within it)
-that all the same creature types run the function each turn.

The first one in particular is bad. I saw lots of things like:
return 'reproduce'
return 'eat'
return 'rest'
because they thought they could do one then the next, then the next.

HOW TO MAKE THIS EASIER:
if critters have a board reference then you can simplify their code. also make a function for the team check and add in printed warning feedback if a move is blocked.

HOW TO MAKE THIS MORE INTERESTING:
creatures attack with rock paper scissors and enemies defend in the same way. They get told how they've been attacked. Need to spend energy to change attack or defense modes.
