'''
For 35 points, create an ASCII animation using time.sleep and print.
Your animation needs to be significantly different from my example below.
You can still use stick figures.

Note: You may wish to resize the output window at the bottom of the screen to make this work.

For example, here is a stick person who waves one arm:
'''

import time
print(' o ')
print('-|-')
print(' ^')
time.sleep(0.5)
print(' o ')
print('-|/')
print(' ^')
time.sleep(0.5)
print(' o ')
print('-|-')
print(' ^')
time.sleep(0.5)
print(' o ')
print('-|/')
print(' ^')
time.sleep(0.5)
print(' o ')
print('-|-')
print(' ^')
time.sleep(0.5)
print(' o ')
print('-|/')
print(' ^')
time.sleep(0.5)
