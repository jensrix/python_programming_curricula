For 140 points, create a Square class that is similar to the circle class
in the associated shared code. You will also need to write a short main.py
program.

Use circle.py and main.py as examples.

The constructor for your square class takes one argument, the size of one 
side of the square. Your square must have two functions: getArea and 
getPerimeter which will calculate and return the area and perimeter.

Next write a third function named fitsIn. fitsIn takes two arguments, a 
width and a height. fitsIn returns True if a rectangle with the given width 
and height could fit in the square. fitsIn returns False otherwise.

Write a short test program, main.py, that creates a Square and calls its
functions, similar to what is done in main.py with circle.
