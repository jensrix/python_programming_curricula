For a minimum of 70 points and a maximum of 300 points (depending on how
much code you add), add and use one new attribute and one new function
in the Dragon and Character classes.

Code is provided that uses objects to play a text based game in which the 
player chooses a name and to be a wizard, rogue, or warrior and then tries
to defeat a dragon.

Your project is to extend the code to make the game more interesting. You 
may also add your own ideas or change the existing gameplay.


Here are some suggestions of things you may add:
- Add health points to the Character, which decrease when the character 
 makes the wrong decision. Then make it possible  to lose the game.
- Add a fourth stat to the Character along with a fourth  action making use 
 of the stat and a fourth Character class that specializes in the stat.
- Add a takeDamage function to the dragon and write this function so that 
 it decreases the dragon's hp and makes the dragon print "Ouch!"
- Add one or more abilities for the dragon to perform to make the game more
 interactive. These abilities must be written as functions in the dragon 
 class and must be called in the main loop of the game.
- Multiple enemies
- Give the character a default role or otherwise deal with the issue of the 
 user mistyping a role. For example, what if the user types in that they want
 their character class to be rouge.
