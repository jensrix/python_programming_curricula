Title: Python: For Loops 1


The following function is supposed to print a given word 10 times, but it has one flaw
def repeatTen():
    for i in range(10):
        print(word)
It needs a return
It needs an argument, word
The loop needs an int
A colon is missing


Does 4 or 7 get passed to the addTwo function?
x = 7
def addTwo(x):

x = addTwo(x)
print(x)


The condition variable is either True or False. What can the following program NEVER print?
text = ''
if condition:
	text = text+'A'
elif not condition:
	text = text+'B'
if condition:
	text = text+'C'
print(text)
AC
A cannot print only A
BC


condition1 and condition2 are either True or False. What can the following program NEVER print?
text = ''
if condition1:
	text = text+'A'
if condition2:
	text = text+'B'
if condition1:
	text = text+'C'
print(text)
AC
A cannot print only A
B
ABC
