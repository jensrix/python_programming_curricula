For 70 points, Write a program that makes your turtle draw a 
gradient across the screen. A gradient is a gradually changing
color.

Here is an example of how to gradually change a turtle's color
import turtle
t = turtle.Turtle()
for i in range(100):
	t.color(0,0,i/100)

Do this project in steps.

Step 1 SETUP: setup consists of importing turtle, creating your 
turtle, lifting the pen up, positioning it on the screen where 
you want it to start, setting the pen size, then putting the pen 
down.

Step 2 WALK: telling your turtle how to walk all over screen is 
best written using a loop. 

There are many ways to walk over the whole screen. You could walk 
in a sawtooth pattern, up down over repeat. You could walk along 
a diagonal, shading the gradient at an angle as you walk from one 
corner to the opposite corner. You could even look at the circle 
drawing code from your face program and fill the screen with 
concentric circles.

Consider drawing on paper the path you want your turtle to walk 
then figure out what goto (or forward and setheading) commands will 
get you there. At what point does your drawing on paper repeat? 
That's what needs to go inside your loop. What values (x or y) are
increasing as your drawing progresses? The answer is a hint as to how 
to use the loop variable.

Step 3 COLORING: worry about changing the turtle's color last.
