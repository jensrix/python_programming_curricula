Code for students to practice simulating on paper. This is not great code, but it seems ok at first glance. Give students a left and right handed L maze. And also left and right side starting H mazes. Ask the students for which mazes this code works and for which it does not work.
    runner.moveAhead(maze)
    runner.turnRight()
    if not runner.wallAhead(maze):
        runner.moveAhead(maze)
    if runner.wallAhead(maze):
        runner.turnLeft()


An example of implementing remembering where a maze runner has been before:
    #Have I been here before?
    if (runner.col,runner.row) in runner.memorylist:
        print("I have been here before")

    #Remember where I have been with no duplicates
    if not( (runner.col,runner.row) in runner.memorylist ):
        runner.memorylist.append( (runner.col,runner.row) )

    print(runner.memorylist)
