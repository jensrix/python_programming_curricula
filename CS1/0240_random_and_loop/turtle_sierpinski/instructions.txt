For 70 points, follow the directions below carefully to create
a turtle program that will draw a surprise image.


Step 1: import turtles and random

Step 2: Test your imports by creating a turtle and moving it 
to a random location.

Step 3: Choose 3 coordinates far enough apart that you could 
draw a big triangle on the screen between them.
Store the values of these coordinates in variables. Consider 
naming the variables x1, y1, x2, etc.

Step 4: Test that your points are located where you think they 
are by having your turtle draw circles at each point.

Step 5: Use random to randomly print one of your 3 pairs of 
coordinates. This will require if, elif, and else. Think about
how you can make the probability that the first, second, or 
third pair gets printed equally likely.

Step 6: Put the code that randomly prints one of the 3 
coordinate pairs in a for loop that repeats at least 100 times.
Your program should now print each coordinate endlessly in a 
random order.

Step 7: Change the code slightly to print the x and y coordinate 
halfway between the randomly chosen coordinate and the turtle's 
current x,y location.

The average is just the sum of the coordinates divided by two.
You want to add your turtle's x coordinate, plus the randomly 
chosen x coordinate, then divide by two and remember the result.
Do the same thing for the y coordinates.

If your turtle's name is t, you can ask for t's x coordinate with
t.xcor()
You can ask for the y coordinate with
t.ycor()

Step 8: Each loop move the turtle to the location halfway 
between the randomly chosen corner and the turtle's current 
x,y location. You should have calculated these values in the
previous step, now use goto to move your turtle to the new
location.

Step 9: Lift the turtle's pen up BEFORE using the goto. After the
goto, draw a small circle (2 to 4 pixels).

Turn in your code and describe what gets drawn on the screen 
after the program runs. You may want to loop more than 100 times.
