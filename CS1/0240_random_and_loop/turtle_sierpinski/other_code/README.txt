3 random dots. Pick a random starting point anywhere, maybe not inside the triangle. Then randomly choose one of the three dots, move half way there and make a new point. Iterate and you get sierpinski gasket. You can choose more than 3 points, you can choose to move other fractions of the distance besides half.

You can also have two shapes. Around 6:15 in the video he shows two triangles (2 sets of 3 points). You bounce around within one triangle and with certain probability bounce to the other.
