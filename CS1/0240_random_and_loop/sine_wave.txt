For 35 points, write a program that graphs a sine wave on the 
screen.

You will need to
	import math and turtle
	use math.sin(x)
	use goto
	use a for loop


Use a for loop to loop at least from 0 to 1000. Suppose x is
the name of your loop control variable as in
for x in range(1000):
Tell your turtle to goto the x coordinate x, and the y coordinate
math.(x)
