For 8 points, answer the following questions.



'''Programs need a way to remember information. This might be 
information that the user typed in or values that change as the 
program runs.

A robot would like to know its location and direction.

A music app would like to remember your favorite songs.

This information is stored in variables.

Here is a variable named x. I have put the value of 7 in x.'''
x = 7

#Here is a variable named street. I have put the value of Candelaria in street.
street = "Candelaria"

#Think of variables as labeled containers. They have two parts, 
#a name (or label) and a value. The value is what's inside the container.

#Creating a variable means creating a variable name and giving the name a value.

# x is the name. 7 is the value.
x = 7

# name is the name. "Timbob" is the value.
name = "Timbob"

# pi is the name. 3.14 is the value
pi = 3.14

#1. What is the name and what is the value?
y = 7.6

#2. What is the name and what is the value?
room = 'lab 9'

#3. What happens if I run a program with this line of code?
7 = x

#4. What happens if I run a program with this line of code?
'lab 9' = room

'''The variable name ALWAYS goes on the left. This is NOT mathematical equals.
In Python equals in Python means assignment.
x = 2
x is assigned the value of 2.
Equals means keep, save, remember, record.
It means create a variable and put a value in it.'''

'''We can re-use variables by assigning new values to them.
5. What does the following program print?'''
food = "green eggs"
food = "ham" #We've replaced the previous value with a new value.
#The old value of "green eggs" is gone forever.
print(food)

'''This might seem surprising. Remember that variables are containers.
But, whenever something new is put in the container, the old thing
vanishes.
6. What does the following program print?'''
name = "Trinket"
name = "Python"
print(name)

'''Where does the old value go? It gets erased to make room 
for the new value. What if we want to save the old value, remember 
it for later? Then we need a new variable.
7. What gets printed here?'''
name = "Nala"
lion = name
name = "Simba"
print(lion)
print(name)


'''Variables are named with underscores between words. All lowercase
Variable names should be nouns.

8. Fix the formatting of each of the following variable names:'''
Rabbit
BigNumber
loop_Control_Variable
NAME
starDust

'''9. If your first, middle(if you have one), and last name was 
all one variable name, how would it be written?'''

#10. Does "case sensitive" mean I'm picky about luggage? What does it mean?

#11. Which of the following lines of code assigns a string value to a variable?
name = first_name + last_name
name == "Marcus"
name = 8
name

#12. Write code to create a variable with the name head_of_school and the value Sinfield.

#13. Suppose a variable named temperature exists. Write code to set temperature equal to 98.6.

#14. Suppose email_address is a variable name. Write code to print the value of the variable named email_address.

#15. Suppose a variable named guests exists. Write code to add one to guests.

#16. Write code to create a variable with the name president_lincoln and the value 16.
