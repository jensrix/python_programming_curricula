For 15 points, answer the following questions.


'''Variable names should be descriptive and short. This can be challenging.

Consider the following question:

What is a good name for a variable storing the number of years she has worked?
A. x
B. my_integer
C. years
D. years_worked
The correct answer is D. years_worked.
I would also give partial credit or even full credit for C. years.'''


'''1. Suppose you're writing a program to manage a webpage and you want 
to count the number of hits that the webpage gets. You will need to 
define an integer variable to count the number of hits.
Write a concise but descriptive name for this variable.'''

'''2. Suppose you're writing a program to correct typos in a text 
document. You need a variable to hold a list of commonly misspelled words.
Write a concise but descriptive name for this variable.'''

'''3. Suppose you're writing a program for NASA and you need a variable 
to store the fraction of a rocket's weight that must be fuel.
Write a concise but descriptive name for this variable.'''

'''4. Suppose you're writing a computer game. You need a variable 
to store the delay between shots from the player's weapon.
Write a concise but descriptive name for this variable.'''

'''5. Suppose you're writing an address book app. You need a variable 
to store a list of the userâ€™s most frequent contacts.

#6. Multiple choice: number_of_cards
A. number of cards is most likely an integer variable.
B. number of cards is most likely a function.
C. number of cards is most likely an boolean variable.
D. number of cards is most likely an object.

'''7. Match the variable names on the left with the program in which 
you might find such a variable on the right.'''
W. contacts		A. Rocket Launch Simulator
X. score		B. Video Chat App
Y. connection	C. Video Game
Z. velocity		D. Texting and Email Application

'''8. The following code is broken. How do I need to write it to assign 
the value of 10 to the variable width?'''
10 = width

'''You can only do two things with a variable, ask for the value 
or set the value.

If a variable shows up on the left side of an equals sign, then a value
is being put into the variable.
If a variable shows up ANYWHERE ELSE then the code is asking for the value 
of the variable.

For example:'''
#Put the value of 1 into x
x = 1
#Put the value of x into y
y = x
#Replace the value of x with a new value
x = 99
#y has not changed. It still has its old value
print(y)

#9. What does the previous program print?

#10. On line 3, a is set equal to the value of b. What is the value of a after line 3?
a = 8
b = 4
a = b+1  #What is the value of a now?
b = a
print(a)
print(b)

#11. Write a line of code that increases the value of x by 10
#12. Write a line of code that sets the value of x to 9283
#The two lines of code in 11 and 12 should be different.
x = 9273

#Variables have to be assigned a value before they can be used in the program.
#13. Which of the following lines of code will throw an error? List all correct answers.
A. count = 7
B. count = total - 4
C. count values + 1
D. count
