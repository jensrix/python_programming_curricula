'''Comments are notes you write to yourself, in English, in your programs. Python ignores all comments. They do not affect how your program runs. Comments should be written BEFORE a block of code to describe the whats and whys of the code that follows. For example:'''
#Ask the user their name so we can say hello
name = input(“What is your name?”)
print(“Hello, ”+name)


'''1. PyScripter colors comments what color?'''


'''2. Comments can also be useful to try a variation of a line of code without deleting it. What does the following program print?'''
#print("Do I get a new line/n like this?")
print("Do I get a new line\n like this?")

'''3. Why does the above program only print once?'''


'''To comment multiple lines of code, use 3 apostrophes or 3 quotation marks to start the comment and another 3 to end it. Try it out.'''



'''Comments are for organizing and clarifying the reason why the code is what it is.
4. Which of the following comments explains the why of the code?'''
#A: Increase money by 200
#B: Reward the player for passing go
money = money + 200


'''You don't want to simply repeat what the code does in the comment. Your comment should add something new.
5. Which of the following comments adds something new?'''
#A: If two players are in the same location, they will meet.
#B: Check to see if the coordinates of self and other are the same. If so, call activateMeeting.
if self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y:
	activateMeeting()
