=== CONTENT ===
I've compiled an enormous stockpile of resources for teaching computer programming in Python. I'm transitioning from teaching high school to teaching at community college and I don't want all the time I've spent creating these resources to go to waste. I hope someone out there will find some of this material useful. At the following links you will find three years worth of content including exercises, projects, quizzes, and videos.

There are 3 main folders: CS1, CS2, and CS3. Each contains a "points_chart" file. I designed my courses to be self-paced. I found this to work well because some students flew ahead while others struggled. The points_chart documents allow students to work at their own pace by choosing the projects they want to do while earning sufficient points for the year.

I did also lecture, but do not have any formal, written lecture material to include.

Also checkout the readme for links to kahoot quizzes that go along with the course.

I hope this massive resource of material is useful to someone. Here are just a few interesting projects included:

Early on in year 1, create a stop motion ASCII animation (CS1\0060_ascii_animation\).
At the end of year 1, implement a game of Tron Light Cycles (CS1\0450_tron_light_cycles) of Flappy Bird (CS1\0490_project_flappy_bird) in Pygame.

Year 2:

Early in year 2, use Turtles and recursion to draw a fractal tree (CS2\1275_turtle_recursion\2500_trees). Midway through year 2, learn about sorting algorithms and Big O notation (CS2\9100_sorting_algorithms). At the end of year 1, write code to control a computer player in a Pygame clone of https://diep.io/ then compete against your friends to see who can write the best bot (CS2\9900_diepio).

Year 3:
